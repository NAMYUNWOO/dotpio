  - `lua scripts/regression_build_preview_confirm.lua` ✅
  - `bash scripts/capture_screenshots.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - F9 now opens a dedicated build preview/confirm dialog instead of executing immediately.
  - Preview includes folder, planned component count, SRL have/need, and compact component summary for material visibility.
  - Cancel path returns to browsing with explicit `BUILD CANCELED` status.
- Follow-up:
  - Next M1 UX priority: make BUILDER.SRL affordance explicit in action menu + F9 flow copy.

## 2026-03-19 02:44:44 KST
- Task: M1 BUILDER.SRL affordance copy pass (action menu + F9 flow).

- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Files: `src/hud.lua`, `main.lua`, `screenshots/screenshot-map04.png`, `screenshots/screenshot-inventory-dos.png`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p main.lua src/hud.lua` ✅
  - `bash scripts/capture_screenshots.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Mission panel now includes explicit unlock row: `UNLOCK: ADVANCED SCHEMATICS [ON/OFF]`.

  - `lua scripts/regression_fail_forward_rewards.lua` ✅
  - `bash scripts/capture_screenshots.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Pressing `R` now resets run state and opens a modal run summary with mission snapshot rows, unlock status, and carryover package details.
  - Summary snapshot is captured before mission reset so progress is preserved for review even after the new run starts.
  - Summary can be dismissed via `R`/`Enter`/`Esc` to keep keyboard-only UX flow intact.
- Follow-up:
  - Next UX priority: M4 DOS terminology consistency pass.

## 2026-03-19 10:13:54 KST

- Task: Mission momentum bonus payout experiment (objective completion streak SRL micro-reward).
- Decision: Logged lane impact for streak-based reward model (1,1,2 SRL) with reward cap and no duplicate payout on already-complete objectives.
- Evidence: `src/run_missions.lua`, `main.lua`, `scripts/regression_mission_momentum.lua` (+ mission regressions).
- Follow-up: Monitor telemetry for early-run SRL inflation and tune reward curve if low-tier churn increases.

## 2026-03-20 00:26 KST — cross-lane sync note
- Context: World/System completed map_03~07 identity metadata + encounter rhythm profile wiring.
- Impact: No content schema break; existing flows remain stable with differentiated pacing.

  - `bash scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Weekly sustain runner now emits a single markdown dashboard rollup (economy safety, telemetry freshness, scheduler audit signal).
  - Dashboard consumes cron audit JSON when available and degrades gracefully to warning when managed cron entry is absent.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P2 priority: `Add automatic stale-branch/report drift check`.

## 2026-03-20 02:26 KST — P2 stale-branch/report drift guardrail handoff

## 2026-03-20 05:44 KST
- Task: UX readability pass for berserker threat escalation.
- Files: `main.lua`, `src/hud.lua`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p main.lua src/hud.lua` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added high-salience status line when visible berserker first enrages (`BERSERKER ENRAGED...`).
  - HUD now shows compact `Berserk: <n>` indicator to reduce surprise burst damage moments.
- Follow-up:
  - If playtests still show surprise hits, add a pre-lunge wind-up cue.

## 2026-03-20 06:02 KST
- Task: UX readability update for berserker pre-lunge warning.
- Files: `main.lua`, `src/hud.lua`

  - HUD now shows compact `Lunge Tell: <n>` indicator alongside `Berserk` count.

## 2026-03-20 06:30 KST — Berserker recovery feedback copy
- Decision: emit explicit status text for recovery turn (`BERSERKER RECOVERING: BRIEF BREATHER`) so players can identify safe reposition windows.
- Impact: status feed now distinguishes telegraph danger vs post-lunge recovery breathing room.
- Follow-up: evaluate if HUD should also surface recovery count when multiple berserkers are active.

## 2026-03-20 06:58 KST — HUD berserker recovery counter readability slice
- HUD now surfaces `Recovering: N` when desperate berserkers are in post-lunge recovery windows.
- Decision: stacked row rendering keeps strip compact while avoiding overlap when both tell/recovery counters are active.

## 2026-03-20 07:26 KST — Variety bonus anticipation affordance
- Decision: players now see upcoming lane-switch bonus in HUD before completion, reducing hidden-reward confusion.
- Copy/UI: mission meta row now conditionally renders `NEXT:<lane> +1` only when an alternate-lane objective remains.
- Follow-up: consider matching run-summary annotation if user testing asks for post-run visibility.

## 2026-03-20 07:56 KST — Run-summary parity for mission variety feedback
- Decision: mission variety bonus count now appears in both in-run HUD and run summary row for pre/post-run consistency.
- Copy/UI: `PACK ... STREAK ... VAR ...` format retained in DOS-style compact metadata line.

## 2026-03-20 08:28 KST — Threat strip compact readability pass

- Kept existing rows (`Berserk`, `Lunge Tell`, `Recovering`) unchanged to avoid extra HUD clutter.
- Follow-up: evaluate whether tier color shift is needed after next screenshot/playtest pass.

## 2026-03-20 09:28 KST — Threat strip legibility update
- Copy unchanged (`Threat: <score> (<tier>)`), but tier line now uses tier-aware color for faster interpretation.
- Decision: preserve text-first readability and avoid hidden color-only meaning by keeping explicit tier token.

## 2026-03-20 10:06 KST — Combat status formula hint copy
- Added compact enrage status suffix (`[THREAT=B+2L+R]`) so players learn threat math from existing combat feed.
- Added HUD formula row only while berserkers are active to avoid baseline HUD noise.

## 2026-03-20 10:35 KST — Signed threat-delta copy pass
- Added concise copy token `THREAT Δ:+n|-n` with explicit sign to communicate momentum shifts without requiring color interpretation.
- Follow-up: if line density becomes noisy at low resolutions, gate delta row behind active-berserker + nonzero-change mode.

## 2026-03-20 10:58 KST — Threat-aware onboarding micro-tip
- Added transitional onboarding copy after first build: `COMBAT TIP: THREAT shows pressure, THREAT Δ shows if danger is rising.`
- Tip auto-decays once the player witnesses first berserker threat event, keeping early readability without long-term HUD noise.
- Follow-up: if onboarding line pressure rises, shorten to token form (`TIP: THREAT/Δ`).

## 2026-03-20 11:06 KST — Pressure-breaker HUD/status readability pass
- Added HUD counter `Dodge: <n>` near HP/MP for immediate survivability context.
- Added status feed copy for charge trigger (`PRESSURE BREAKER: DODGE CHARGE TRIGGERED`).
- Mission reward status now appends compact pressure-breaker suffix showing gained charge, TTL, and ready count.

## 2026-03-20 11:26 KST — Overclock status copy pass
- Added concise feed copy on pulse start/end:
  - `OVERCLOCK ONLINE: BUILD COST DISCOUNT ACTIVE, ENEMIES AGGRO BOOSTED`
  - `OVERCLOCK COOLED: SRL DISCOUNT OFF`
- Added compact HUD hint cycle (`OVERCLOCK READY`, `OVERCLOCK HOT`, `OVERCLOCK CD`) to communicate temporary window state without extra controls.

## 2026-03-20 12:01 KST — Weekly changelog drift detector rollout
- Completed backlog item: `QA/Systems: Add weekly changelog drift detector (code changes without corresponding team-log/report entry)`.

- Follow-up:
  - Backlog item marked done; queue next Game Director/Ops candidate.


## 2026-03-20 13:28 KST — Overclock hazard HUD countdown readability pass
- Decision: Overclock status hint now includes live seconds for active pulse (`OVERCLOCK HOT <n>s`) and cooldown (`OVERCLOCK CD <n>s`) to reduce timing ambiguity.
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua`.
- Follow-up: Consider mirroring countdown near build preview panel for players who open inventory during hazard pulses.

## 2026-03-20 14:00 KST — Sustain dashboard regression-risk driver breakdown
- Decision: Added `regressionRisk.topDrivers` (top 3 contributors) to dashboard payload and markdown so ops reviews can immediately see what is driving score changes.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py`; `python3 scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py --format json --pretty`.
- Follow-up: If risk repeatedly trends WARN/ALERT, add automated recommendation mapping each driver to a concrete remediation runbook step.

## 2026-03-20 14:29 KST — Overclock hint clarity pass shipped
- Completed: overclock HUD hint now always includes `RISK:<tier>(<score>)` across READY/HOT/CD states.

- Follow-up: evaluate color treatment for risk tier text in future HUD compression pass.

## 2026-03-20 14:56 KST — overclock aggro-pressure legend follow-up
- Task: Add active-pulse HUD hint legend for overclock aggro pressure (`AGGRO DET:+n MOVE:+m%`).
- Decision: Keep mechanic unchanged; surface detect/move pressure explicitly in HOT hint for faster risk parsing.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`.
- Follow-up: Observe readability during next map_07 playtest and adjust wording only if hint width becomes noisy.

- Scope: `src/overclock_hazard.lua`, `scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Decision: Relief window now arms only when player disengages during HOT and pulse then expires while outside; token is shown only during out-of-zone cooldown and auto-expires.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` (PASS).
- Follow-up: Next unchecked backlog item is overclock dwell-bucket telemetry (`LOW|MID|HIGH`).

- Decision: expose derivation path directly from sandbox-target resolver (`LOCK` when lane-lock derived, `MIXED` when sandbox active without single-lane lock, `NONE` when sandbox inactive) for quick auditability.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits `sandboxTargetSource` in JSON, adds `targetSource` signal, and renders markdown line `TARGET SRC`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; digest regeneration PASS.
- Follow-up: next highest unchecked item is `TARGET SHIFT:<FROM->TO>` history token.

## 2026-03-21 15:38 KST — Cycle R closure: sandbox target history token
- Completed remaining Cycle R backlog item: `TARGET SHIFT:<FROM->TO>` in weekly portal prompt readability digest.
- Digest now emits JSON fields `sandboxTargetShift`, `sandboxTargetShiftSignals` and markdown row `TARGET SHIFT`.
- Shift semantics compare prior digest `sandboxTarget` to current target; emits stable `X->X` when unchanged and still reports prior-load/change signals for auditability.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120 ...` PASS.

## 2026-03-21 16:01 KST — Cycle S digest UX note
- Decision: Kept new readiness token copy compact (`SANDBOX READY`) with cause tuple `(sandbox/conf/guard/lock)` for DOS-style quick scanning.
- Follow-up: evaluate whether `WHAT-IF ALT` preview should collapse to compact mode token when width budget is tight.

## 2026-03-21 16:33 KST — Cycle S digest stability token (`ACTION STABILITY`)
- Task: Add `ACTION STABILITY:LOCKED|WATCH` derived from `ACTION CONF + FOCUS VOL + DRIFT MOMENTUM` to reduce retune whiplash.
- Decision: Classified as `LOCKED` only when confidence is MID/HIGH, focus volatility is STEADY, and drift momentum is FLAT/COOLING; otherwise `WATCH`.
- Evidence:
  - Updated `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` with `route_action_stability_from_signals`, JSON fields (`actionStability`, `actionStabilitySignals`), and markdown digest line.
  - Extended `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` assertions for new schema + markdown token.
  - Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS), `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120` (PASS).
- Follow-up: Remaining highest-priority unchecked item is Cycle S `WHAT-IF ALT:<lane> ΔRISK:<n>` experiment behind flag.

## 2026-03-21 17:01 KST — Digest readability addition (`WHAT-IF`)
- Added markdown digest row: `WHAT-IF: ALT:<lane> ΔRISK:<n>` with compact context tuple and explicit flag state.
- Readability intent: preserve DOS-style single-line scan while surfacing alternate-lane planning cue.
- Follow-up: if line budget gets tight, evaluate compact fallback tokenization in prompt digest output.

## 2026-03-21 17:31 KST
- Task: UX/readability pass for digest what-if projection trust.
- Decision: Surface confidence as 3-tier enum (LOW/MID/HIGH) to avoid binary overconfidence.
- Follow-up: add alignment token to reduce ambiguity between suggested ALT lane and route action.

## 2026-03-21 18:01 KST — Cycle T what-if alignment token
- Completed: Added digest token `WHAT-IF ALIGN:ALIGNED|DIVERGED` derived from `ALT LANE` vs `ROUTE ACTION` mapping.
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up: implement remaining Cycle T item `WHAT-IF BAND:GAIN|NEUTRAL|LOSS`.

## 2026-03-21 18:31 KST — Cycle U HUD/report readability extension (`WHAT-IF MAG`)
- Completed: digest now includes `WHAT-IF MAG` line with explicit `delta`, `|Δ|`, and flag state for quick operator scan.
- UX rationale: directional token (`BAND`) + size token (`MAG`) reduces ambiguity when delta is near zero.
- Follow-up: evaluate if `WHAT-IF MAG` should collapse to compact shorthand in narrow-copy mode.

## 2026-03-21 19:03 KST — HUD/digest copy lane
- Updated weekly digest copy with `WHAT-IF FIT` line (pressure/current vs projected context).
- Keeps existing token order intact (`WHAT-IF`, `CONF`, `ALIGN`, `BAND`, `MAG`, `FIT`).

## 2026-03-21 19:33 KST — Cycle U what-if fallback token (`WHAT-IF FALLBACK`) shipped
- Completed backlog item: prototype `WHAT-IF FALLBACK:<lane>` behind flag when what-if alternate lane diverges from route action.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits `whatIfFallback` + `whatIfFallbackSignals` and markdown line `WHAT-IF FALLBACK`.
- Flag contract: `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_FALLBACK` (OFF by default). When enabled + `WHAT-IF ALIGN:DIVERGED`, fallback resolves to route-action lane (`PORTAL|ALT|PRESSURE`), otherwise `NONE`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120 --out-json logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.json --out-md logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.md`.
- Follow-up: All ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC items are checked; next cycle should run Game Director review loop (3 ideas -> 1 experiment -> slice).

## 2026-03-21 19:36 KST — Game Director Cycle V (ideas + selected vertical slice)
- Candidate ideas:
  1) Low-risk UX: `WHAT-IF FALLBACK CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` from fallback divergence + route confidence.

- Added glanceable rollback sizing (`SMALL|MED|LARGE`) for fallback action confidence calibration.
- Added optional dual-path cue (`ALT2`) for faster triage during divergent lane windows.

## 2026-03-21 22:04 KST — Digest readability augmentation (`ALT2 CONF`)
- Added compact line `WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALT2 CONF` immediately after `WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALT2` to avoid forcing operators into JSON for trust context.
- Keeps existing token order and compact DOS-style line formatting.
- Regression: markdown presence asserted in `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.

## 2026-03-21 22:33:50 KST
- UX update: Weekly markdown digest now includes explicit `WHAT-IF FALLBACK PLAN` line immediately after ALT2 confidence.
- Rationale: Reduce ambiguity when both primary and secondary fallback candidates exist.

## 2026-03-21 22:36:47 KST

- Completed backlog item: added flagged dual-route split recommendation token `WHAT-IF SPLIT:ON|OFF` in weekly portal readability digest.
- Decision: gate behind `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT`; emit `ON` only when primary/secondary fallback lanes are both actionable, diverged, and pass confidence + |ΔRISK| threshold.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
- Follow-up: with TASKS + POST_RC backlog now fully checked, next cycle should start Game Director review loop (3 ideas -> pick 1 -> minimal vertical slice).

## 2026-03-21 23:36 KST — Game Director Cycle Z review + selected vertical slice
- Idea set:
  1) Low-risk UX: `WHAT-IF SPLIT CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` trust token for split recommendation.

## 2026-03-22 00:33 KST — Digest readability update (`WHAT-IF SPLIT SAFE`)
- Added markdown token `WHAT-IF SPLIT SAFE` with compact context tuple (flag state, split state, fit, ALT2 confidence gate).
- Keeps ordering stable and surfaces go/no-go safety signal without opening JSON artifacts.
- Follow-up: monitor copy width if additional split tokens are added next cycle.

## 2026-03-22 01:01 KST — Game Director Cycle AA: split posture vertical slice
- Backlog lifecycle: set `WHAT-IF SPLIT POSTURE` to `[~]` before implementation, then promoted to `[x]` after verification in `TASKS.md` + `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Idea slate generated:
  1) Low-risk UX (chosen): `WHAT-IF SPLIT POSTURE:SAFE|WATCH|HOLD`.

- Decision: cooloff starts at 1 when split flips ON->OFF, increments while split stays OFF, resets to 0 on split ON.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` passed.
- Follow-up: next unchecked item is flagged novelty `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESCALATE:ON`.

## 2026-03-22 02:03 KST
- Task: Operator-facing wording review for split escalation sentinel.
- Decision: Emit binary `ON|OFF` token with explicit reason text so triage is glanceable without opening JSON.
- Follow-up: none for this slice (no in-game HUD/UI impact).

## 2026-03-22 02:36 KST
- Task: Cycle AB follow-up closure — split escalation readability/cooloff tokens (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC LANES`, `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC COOL`).
- Files: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅, `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 30 --max-commits 50 --out-json /tmp/dotpio-weekly.json --out-md /tmp/dotpio-weekly.md` ✅.

- Follow-up: ACTION_ITEMS has only tracking legend `- [ ] todo` remaining; next meaningful priority is to continue digest Game Director line when new actionable items are injected.

## 2026-03-22 03:04 KST — Game Director Cycle AC vertical slice closure (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE`)
- Task: Add split escalation lifecycle state token for weekly portal prompt digest triage.
- Ideas generated:
  1) Low-risk UX (selected): `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE:ARMED|COOLING|IDLE`.
  2) Mid-risk systems: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC PRESSURE:LOW|MID|HIGH` cooldown pressure band.
  3) High-risk novelty: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane>` post-escalation recovery route hint.
- Decision: Ship idea #1 as minimal vertical slice and inject #2/#3 as follow-up backlog candidates.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits JSON fields `whatIfSplitEscState` + `whatIfSplitEscStateSignals` and markdown line `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE`.

  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 60` ✅
- Backlog lifecycle: marked Cycle AC state-token item `[~] -> [x]` in `TASKS.md` and `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`; follow-up items remain unchecked.
- Next hook: implement Cycle AC mid/high experiments (`ESC PRESSURE`, `ESC RECOVER`) in subsequent loop.

## 2026-03-22 03:31 KST — Cycle AC follow-up: split escalation cooldown pressure-band token
- Completed task: Add  behind .
- Decision: token defaults to  with explicit  reason; when enabled, pressure derives from current pressure band with lifecycle-aware cooling decay (=base,  decays 1~2 steps,  minimized).
- Verification: py_compile + [PASS] weekly portal prompt readability drift regression checks + digest generation PASS.
- Next: implement remaining Cycle AC item  behind flag.

## 2026-03-22 03:33 KST — Cycle AC follow-up: split escalation cooldown pressure-band token (corrected log)
- Completed task: Add `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC PRESSURE:LOW|MID|HIGH` behind `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_PRESSURE`.
- Decision: token defaults to `LOW` with explicit `flag-disabled` reason; when enabled, pressure derives from current pressure band with lifecycle-aware cooling decay (`ARMED`=base, `COOLING` decays 1~2 steps, `IDLE` minimized).
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + weekly digest generation PASS.
- Next: implement remaining Cycle AC item `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane>` behind flag.

## 2026-03-22 03:41 KST — Game Director Cycle AD vertical slice: split escalation recovery hint

- Shipped: weekly digest now emits WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane> behind DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER; when enabled it suggests the lowest-pressure actionable lane from escalation lane-pair, otherwise OFF/NONE with explicit reason.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md.
- Verification: python3 -m py_compile + python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py + digest generation PASS.
- Backlog sync: Cycle AC recovery item closed; Cycle AD injected with recovery-confidence + recovery-alt follow-ups.

## 2026-03-22 04:01 KST — Cycle AD: Split Escalation Recovery Confidence
- Completed: Added WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH token derived from recovery lane availability, escalation lifecycle state, lane divergence, and pressure easing context.
- Decision: Confidence stays LOW when recover route is OFF/NONE or state is ARMED; rises to MID/HIGH only during easing (COOLING/IDLE) with actionable/divergent lanes and manageable pressure.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md
- Verification: python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py (PASS); python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py (PASS).
- Next: Implement WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ALT:<lane> prototype behind flag for contingency planning.

## 2026-03-22 04:33 KST — Operator UX continuity
- Recovery fallback token appears only when feature-flag path is active (`OFF` otherwise), matching existing experiment-token UX expectations.
- Copy remains one-line compact to avoid DOS digest bloat.

## 2026-03-22 04:41 KST — Cycle AE update
- Injected Game Director Cycle AE slate (3 ideas), shipped selected vertical slice: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ALT CONF`.
- Verification references: weekly portal readability regression + digest generation passed.
- Remaining Cycle AE queue: `RECOVER PLAN`, flagged `RECOVER WHY`.

## 2026-03-22 05:04 KST — HUD/readability log sync

- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` passed.
- Follow-up: all ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC_BACKLOG currently checked; next cycle should run Game Director ideation/injection lane.

## 2026-03-22 05:38 KST — Game Director Cycle AF review + vertical slice
- Idea slate (3):
  1) Low-risk UX (selected): `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER TEMPO:FAST|STEADY|DEFER` (Scope S, rollback: remove digest row).
  2) Mid-risk systems: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ΔCONF:+n|-n` (Scope M, rollback: drop prior-window diff state).
  3) High-risk novelty: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON` under HIGH pressure + LOW confidence (Scope M/L, rollback: flag OFF).
- Selected experiment: #1 tempo token as minimal vertical slice.
- Implementation: weekly digest now emits JSON fields `whatIfSplitEscRecoverTempo` + `whatIfSplitEscRecoverTempoSignals` and markdown line `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER TEMPO`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` pass.
- Backlog injection: added Cycle AF entries to `TASKS.md` and `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md` with selected slice done and two follow-up candidates queued.

## 2026-03-22 06:12 KST — Cycle AF follow-up: split escalation recovery confidence delta
- Completed: Added `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ΔCONF:+n|-n` token by comparing current recovery confidence tier against prior digest window.
- Decision: Use ordinal confidence scoring (`LOW=0`, `MID=1`, `HIGH=2`) and emit signed delta (`+n` / `-n`, zero as `+0`) with explicit `priorLoaded` signal for auditability.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS), `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS)
- Next: implement flagged `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON` sentinel when pressure remains HIGH under low confidence.

## 2026-03-22 06:31 KST — Cycle AF/AG digest follow-up
- Task: Closed remaining Cycle AF unchecked item (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON`) and executed Game Director review cycle because ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC were fully checked.
- Commit: pending (this run)
- Files: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added flag-gated veto sentinel `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON|OFF` (`DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER_VETO`) for HIGH-pressure + LOW-confidence recovery contexts.
  - Ran Game Director cycle ideas (low/mid/high), selected low-risk UX slice, and shipped `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` for trust readability.
  - Injected Cycle AG backlog follow-ups (`VETO WHY`, `VETO COOLOFF`) as next queue items.
- Follow-up:
  - Highest-priority unchecked item now: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO WHY:<short>` (flag-gated).

## [2026-03-22 07:05 KST] Cycle AG - split escalation veto rationale/cooloff tokens
- Decision: Extended weekly portal prompt digest with  (flag: ) and  (flag: ).
- Evidence: updated , ; regression pass.
- Follow-up: continue next unchecked ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS priority item after Cycle AG closure.

## [2026-03-22 07:05 KST] Cycle AG - split escalation veto rationale/cooloff tokens
- Decision: Extended weekly portal prompt digest with WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO WHY (flag: DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER_VETO_WHY) and WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO COOLOFF (flag: DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER_VETO_COOLOFF).
- Evidence: updated scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py and scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py; regression pass.
- Follow-up: continue next unchecked ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS priority item after Cycle AG closure.

## [2026-03-22 07:08 KST] Cycle AH - veto state token vertical slice
- Ideation (3): (1) veto state token (low-risk UX), (2) veto dwell token (mid-risk telemetry), (3) veto release cue token (high-risk novelty copy).
- Picked experiment: veto state token (`ARMED|COOLING|IDLE`) as minimal vertical slice.
- Verification: weekly portal digest regression pass with markdown/token assertions and state-signal unit checks.

## 2026-03-22 07:33 KST — Cycle AH follow-up: veto dwell token
- Task: Add `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO DWELL:<n>` to count consecutive `ARMED` windows.
- Decision: Dwell increments only when current+prior veto state are both `ARMED`; resets to `0` on `COOLING/IDLE` to avoid stale streak carry.
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up: Next unchecked backlog item is `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO RELEASE:<short>` (flag-gated on `COOLING -> IDLE`).

## 2026-03-22 08:02 KST — Cycle AI: veto release confidence token
- Task: Add `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO RELEASE CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` to score trust for release cue transitions.
- Decision: Score HIGH only on clean `COOLING CLEAR + IDLE`, MID while still COOLING, LOW otherwise (ARMED/dwell/no transition) to avoid false release trust.
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up: Remaining Cycle AI backlog items are release route token and release timer token.

## 2026-03-22 08:34 KST — Cycle AI follow-up: veto release route token
- Task: Add `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO RELEASE ROUTE:<lane>` for post-cooldown handoff clarity.
- Decision: Route emits actionable lane only on `COOLING CLEAR -> IDLE` release transitions; otherwise `HOLD` (cooling/armed) or `NONE` when no actionable lane exists.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS) and `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 30 --out-json logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.json --out-md logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.md` (PASS).
- Next: remaining highest-priority unchecked item is `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO RELEASE TICK:<n>` (flag-gated prototype).

## 2026-03-22 09:06 KST — Cycle AJ: veto release pacing phase token
- Task: Close highest-priority unchecked item by adding `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO RELEASE PHASE:IDLE|EARLY|MID|LATE`.
- Decision: Chosen as low-risk UX slice after Game Director ideation (low/mid/high). Mapping is deterministic from release tick count and forwards non-numeric tokens (e.g., `FLAG OFF`) unchanged.
- Implementation: Updated `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` payload/markdown plus regression coverage in `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up: Next highest-priority unchecked item is `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO RELEASE CADENCE:ACCEL|STEADY|DECAY`.

- Task: Digest readability pass for new cadence token.
- Commit: HEAD (pending commit in this run)
- Files: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`
- Verification: Markdown line emission asserted via regression suite ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added compact digest line: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO RELEASE CADENCE` with tick/prior/delta context for glanceable pacing trend.
- Follow-up:
  - Evaluate whether cadence line should collapse details when token is non-numeric (`FLAG OFF`).

## 2026-03-22 09:42 KST
- Task: Digest readability for auto-rearm warning cue.
- Update: Added compact line `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM` with phase/pressure/cadence context.
- Outcome: Operators can spot likely rearm loops without inspecting raw JSON fields.

## 2026-03-22 10:04 KST — Cycle AK: auto-rearm confidence token
- Completed backlog item: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH`.
- Implementation: added `what_if_split_escalate_recover_veto_rearm_confidence_from_signals()` and wired JSON/markdown digest output fields.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` passed.
- Follow-up: next unchecked item is rearm rationale token (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM WHY:<short>`).

## 2026-03-22 10:35 KST — Cycle AK item 2 (rearm rationale token)
- Completed `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM WHY:<short>` vertical slice in weekly portal prompt readability digest.
- Evidence: updated rationale classifier + JSON/markdown wiring + regression coverage in `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up: proceed to Cycle AK item 3 (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM COOLOFF:<n>` behind flag).
## 2026-03-22 11:03 KST — Cycle AK: split escalation auto-rearm cooloff token
- Task: Prototype `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM COOLOFF:<n>` behind flag after WATCH disarms.
- Decision: Added flag-gated cooloff tracker `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER_VETO_REARM_COOLOFF` that increments consecutive OFF windows after prior `WATCH` and resets when `WATCH` is active.
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up: If ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC are fully complete, run next Game Director idea injection cycle.
## 2026-03-22 11:08 KST — Cycle AL experiment slice (cooloff state)
- Ideation set: (1) cooloff state token, (2) pressure-relief fit token, (3) flagged rearm nudge token.
- Chosen experiment: #1 `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM COOLOFF STATE:ACTIVE|IDLE`.
- Implementation: added state reducer from rearm WATCH + cooloff counter; wired JSON payload + markdown digest row.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up backlog injected: remaining Cycle AL items for FIT and NUDGE tokens are queued unchecked.

## 2026-03-22 11:33 KST — Cycle AL systems closure (rearm pressure-relief fit)
- Completed backlog item: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM FIT:RELIEF|EVEN|TENSE` from cooloff + pressure context.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits `whatIfSplitEscRecoverVetoRearmFit` + `...Signals` and markdown row `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM FIT`.
- Rule: ACTIVE cooloff maps by pressure (`LOW->RELIEF`, `MID->EVEN`, `HIGH->TENSE`); IDLE + no cooloff + LOW remains `RELIEF`; HIGH without relief window remains `TENSE`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120` (all PASS).
- Next priority item: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO REARM NUDGE:<short>` (flagged prototype).
