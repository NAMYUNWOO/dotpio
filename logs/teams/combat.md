# Combat Team Log


### 2026-03-19 23:59 KST
- Task: Mission momentum bonus payout experiment (objective completion streak SRL micro-reward).
- Decision: Logged lane impact for streak-based reward model (1,1,2 SRL) with reward cap and no duplicate payout on already-complete objectives.
- Evidence: `src/run_missions.lua`, `main.lua`, `scripts/regression_mission_momentum.lua` (+ mission regressions).
- Follow-up: Monitor telemetry for early-run SRL inflation and tune reward curve if low-tier churn increases.

## 2026-03-20 00:26 KST — cross-lane sync note
- Context: World/System completed map_03~07 identity metadata + encounter rhythm profile wiring.
- Impact: No content schema break; existing flows remain stable with differentiated pacing.
- Follow-up: Validate player readability and portal landmark cues in upcoming portal reposition task.

## 2026-03-20 00:58 KST
- Cross-lane note: World portal reposition pass completed for map_03~07 with validator/regression green.
- Impact: traversal landmarks and fallback routes are clearer; no economy/combat/UI schema changes required in this patch.
- Follow-up: monitor playtest readability feedback and tune labels/cues if confusion persists.

## 2026-03-20 01:28:00 KST
- Task: P2 backlog item `Add weekly sustain audit JSON pretty mode`.
- Commit: HEAD (pending)
- Files:
  - `scripts/audit_weekly_sustain_cron.sh`
  - `scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py`
  - `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added `--pretty` flag for `--format json` to emit indented, human-readable audit payload while keeping compact JSON default stable.
  - Added guardrail: `--pretty` rejects non-JSON formats to avoid ambiguous output modes.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P2 priority: `Add sustain health dashboard markdown report`.

## 2026-03-20 01:59:00 KST
- Task: P2 backlog item `Add sustain health dashboard markdown report`.
- Commit: HEAD (pending)
- Files:
  - scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py
  - scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py
  - scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh
  - logs/playtests/rc_checklist.md
  - POST_RC_BACKLOG.md
  - logs/sustain_health_dashboard.md
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py` ✅
  - `bash scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Weekly sustain runner now emits a single markdown dashboard rollup (economy safety, telemetry freshness, scheduler audit signal).
  - Dashboard consumes cron audit JSON when available and degrades gracefully to warning when managed cron entry is absent.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P2 priority: `Add automatic stale-branch/report drift check`.

## 2026-03-20 02:26 KST — P2 stale-branch/report drift guardrail handoff
- Combat lane verified no combat tuning deltas are involved in this operations-focused task.
- Decision: keep combat regressions out of this checker to avoid duplicate signal noise; checker remains branch/report freshness only.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 03:00 KST — P2 sustain dashboard JSON mode handoff
- Combat lane verified no combat behavior/balance changes in this ops task.
- Decision: keep regression scope focused on dashboard output contracts (markdown + json) to avoid unrelated combat churn.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 03:29 KST — P2 sustain dashboard trend classification handoff
- Combat lane verified no combat tuning/code changes in this ops task.
- Decision: combat pipeline remains unchanged; only sustain dashboard contract updated.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 03:58 KST — cross-lane handoff
- Combat lane impact review: no combat logic/balance adjustments in this task.
- Decision: streak display is HUD/readout only; momentum reward curve (1,1,2) remains unchanged.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 04:29 KST
- Task: Combat systems unchanged in this cycle.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Verification: Indirect via mission regressions passing (`scripts/regression_run_missions.lua`).
- Decisions:
  - No enemy behavior/damage pacing modifications were required for momentum variety bonus.
