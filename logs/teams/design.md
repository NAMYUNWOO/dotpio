# Design Team Log


### 2026-03-19 23:59 KST
- Task: Mission momentum bonus payout experiment (objective completion streak SRL micro-reward).
- Decision: Logged lane impact for streak-based reward model (1,1,2 SRL) with reward cap and no duplicate payout on already-complete objectives.
- Evidence: `src/run_missions.lua`, `main.lua`, `scripts/regression_mission_momentum.lua` (+ mission regressions).
- Follow-up: Monitor telemetry for early-run SRL inflation and tune reward curve if low-tier churn increases.

## 2026-03-20 00:26 KST — cross-lane sync note
- Context: World/System completed map_03~07 identity metadata + encounter rhythm profile wiring.
- Impact: No content schema break; existing flows remain stable with differentiated pacing.
- Follow-up: Validate player readability and portal landmark cues in upcoming portal reposition task.

## 2026-03-20 00:58 KST
- Cross-lane note: World portal reposition pass completed for map_03~07 with validator/regression green.
- Impact: traversal landmarks and fallback routes are clearer; no economy/combat/UI schema changes required in this patch.
- Follow-up: monitor playtest readability feedback and tune labels/cues if confusion persists.

## 2026-03-20 01:28:00 KST
- Task: P2 backlog item `Add weekly sustain audit JSON pretty mode`.
- Commit: HEAD (pending)
- Files:
  - `scripts/audit_weekly_sustain_cron.sh`
  - `scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py`
  - `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added `--pretty` flag for `--format json` to emit indented, human-readable audit payload while keeping compact JSON default stable.
  - Added guardrail: `--pretty` rejects non-JSON formats to avoid ambiguous output modes.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P2 priority: `Add sustain health dashboard markdown report`.

## 2026-03-20 01:59:00 KST
- Task: P2 backlog item `Add sustain health dashboard markdown report`.
- Commit: HEAD (pending)
- Files:

  - `python3 scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py` ✅
  - `bash scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Weekly sustain runner now emits a single markdown dashboard rollup (economy safety, telemetry freshness, scheduler audit signal).
  - Dashboard consumes cron audit JSON when available and degrades gracefully to warning when managed cron entry is absent.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P2 priority: `Add automatic stale-branch/report drift check`.

## 2026-03-20 02:26 KST — P2 stale-branch/report drift guardrail handoff
- Design lane reviewed markdown artifact readability.
- Decision: generate a concise markdown summary (`logs/stale_branch_report_drift.md`) with clear checkmarks/warnings for human weekly review.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 03:00 KST — P2 sustain dashboard JSON mode handoff

- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 03:29 KST — P2 sustain dashboard trend classification handoff
- Design lane reviewed dashboard readability with new trend row.
- Decision: expose trend near overall tier for at-a-glance weekly triage.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 03:58 KST — cross-lane handoff
- Design lane approved compact readability pass for mission pacing metadata (`PACK`, `STREAK`) in both mission panel and run summary.
- Decision: maintain terse DOS-style labels to avoid panel clutter.
- Follow-up: revisit panel density only if additional mission metadata is added.

## 2026-03-20 04:29 KST
- Task: Mission pacing readability micro-pass via status copy.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)

## 2026-03-20 04:59 KST
- Task: Design readability pass for mission metadata row.
- Verification: `luac -p src/hud.lua` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added terse DOS-style `TAG` and `PACE` labels to communicate run rhythm while avoiding panel clutter.

## 2026-03-20 05:29 KST
- Cross-lane design note: introduced berserker as a readability-friendly high-threat archetype (predictable low-HP power spike).
- Decision: keep behavior trigger simple (`hp <= 2`) to maintain player learnability and avoid hidden randomness.
- Follow-up: evaluate optional visual cue for desperation state in a later polish pass.

## 2026-03-20 05:44 KST
- Task: Design readability check for berserker escalation cue.
- Verification: `luac -p src/hud.lua main.lua` ✅

  - Preserved terse DOS-style warning copy and compact HUD telemetry to avoid panel overload.

## 2026-03-20 06:30 KST — Combat readability rhythm adjustment
- Decision: preserve high-threat berserker identity while introducing a recover beat after desperation lunge.
- Rationale: telegraph-only pattern remained punishing in chain engagements; recovery beat improves tactical readability without removing spike moments.
- Follow-up: monitor if map choke points over-amplify recovery exploitation.

## 2026-03-20 06:58 KST — HUD berserker recovery counter readability slice
- Threat strip hierarchy now reads: Berserk -> Lunge Tell -> Recovering, preserving urgency order.
- Decision: use warm amber for recovery indicator to communicate reduced immediate threat vs lunge tell.

## 2026-03-20 07:26 KST — Mission panel readability pass
- Decision: append compact `NEXT:<lane> +1` token to mission metadata row to communicate achievable variety reward with minimal HUD footprint.
- Follow-up: monitor line width if future metadata fields expand.

## 2026-03-20 07:56 KST — HUD readability: add compact mission mastery token
- Decision: added concise `VAR:<n>` alongside `PACK/TAG/STREAK` to communicate earned lane-switch mastery without increasing panel height.
- Follow-up: monitor line-width pressure if future metadata expands.

## 2026-03-20 08:28 KST — HUD hierarchy tweak
- Decision: expanded top-left HUD panel height to preserve legibility while adding threat aggregate line.
- Follow-up: validate alignment against onboarding strip and mission panel in next screenshot pass.

## 2026-03-20 08:56 KST — HUD semantic readability note
- Approved compact text augmentation (`Threat score + tier`) over adding a new panel row to preserve DOS HUD density.

## 2026-03-20 09:28 KST — HUD danger hierarchy polish
- Decision: aligned threat tier semantics with intuitive color hierarchy (safe->warn->danger) for faster glance parsing.
- Constraint: kept DOS density unchanged (no extra row added).

## 2026-03-20 10:06 KST — Threat math affordance placement
- Approved in-strip formula placement under berserker counters instead of a separate panel to preserve DOS hierarchy and keep threat context local.

## 2026-03-20 10:35 KST — Compact hierarchy-preserving delta row
- Approved placing threat delta directly beneath existing threat line to preserve DOS HUD locality and avoid new panel sprawl.

## 2026-03-20 11:06 KST — Combat readability alignment for pressure-breaker
- Kept pressure-breaker communication diegetic and compact (HUD count + status pulse) to avoid crowding the DOS combat strip.
- Maintained existing threat decomposition rows; dodge counter sits in left status cluster for quick glance during movement/combat.

## 2026-03-20 11:26 KST — Risk/reward readability for hazard room prototype
- Kept prototype lightweight: hazard lives in contested center room to make risk legible through natural encounter density.
- Added compact HUD/state messaging (`OVERCLOCK READY/HOT/CD`) instead of new paneling to preserve DOS hierarchy.

## 2026-03-20 12:01 KST — Weekly changelog drift detector rollout
- Completed backlog item: `QA/Systems: Add weekly changelog drift detector (code changes without corresponding team-log/report entry)`.
- Added `scripts/weekly_changelog_drift_check.py` + `scripts/regression_weekly_changelog_drift.py` and wired them into `scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh` / RC sustain checklist.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_changelog_drift_check.py scripts/regression_weekly_changelog_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_changelog_drift.py`; `bash scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh`.
- Follow-up: next backlog priority is `Ops: Add sustain dashboard regression risk score (0~100) with threshold alert section`.

## 2026-03-20 13:05 KST
- Task: P2 Ops backlog — sustain dashboard regression risk score (0~100) + threshold alert section.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Files: `scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py`, `scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py` ✅
  - `bash scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Dashboard now emits `regressionRisk` payload with score/level/alert and fixed thresholds (`warnAt=30`, `alertAt=60`).
  - Markdown dashboard now includes a dedicated **Regression Risk** section with threshold alert status.
- Follow-up:
  - Backlog item marked done; queue next Game Director/Ops candidate.


## 2026-03-20 13:28 KST — Overclock hazard HUD countdown readability pass
- Decision: Overclock status hint now includes live seconds for active pulse (`OVERCLOCK HOT <n>s`) and cooldown (`OVERCLOCK CD <n>s`) to reduce timing ambiguity.
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua`.
- Follow-up: Consider mirroring countdown near build preview panel for players who open inventory during hazard pulses.

## 2026-03-20 14:00 KST — Sustain dashboard regression-risk driver breakdown
- Decision: Added `regressionRisk.topDrivers` (top 3 contributors) to dashboard payload and markdown so ops reviews can immediately see what is driving score changes.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py`; `python3 scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py --format json --pretty`.
- Follow-up: If risk repeatedly trends WARN/ALERT, add automated recommendation mapping each driver to a concrete remediation runbook step.

## 2026-03-20 14:29 KST — Hazard readability hierarchy note
- Approved compact text hierarchy: state token first (`READY/HOT/CD`), then reward/timer, then risk tier.
- Keeps DOS-style single-line affordance without extra panel footprint.

## 2026-03-20 14:56 KST — overclock aggro-pressure legend follow-up
- Task: Add active-pulse HUD hint legend for overclock aggro pressure (`AGGRO DET:+n MOVE:+m%`).
- Decision: Keep mechanic unchanged; surface detect/move pressure explicitly in HOT hint for faster risk parsing.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`.
- Follow-up: Observe readability during next map_07 playtest and adjust wording only if hint width becomes noisy.

## 2026-03-20 16:29 KST — Hazard readability micro-polish
- Decision: Reused existing overclock hint line to retain DOS compactness and avoid panel-height growth.
- Follow-up: Consider unified hazard legend style if more hazard-room variants are introduced.

## 2026-03-20 16:55 KST — Risk/reward pacing pass
- Decision: Overclock room now pays a small pulse-capped kill bounty so players are incentivized to stay in HOT zone briefly instead of always dipping out after build.
- Intent: tighten "high risk center contest" fantasy with immediate SRL feedback.

## 2026-03-20 17:31 KST — Overclock next-pulse bounty budget readability
- Decision: READY/CD overclock HUD hints now include `NEXT BOUNTY:0/y` so players can pre-plan hot-zone reward windows before pulse activation.
- Scope: No combat/economy math changes; display-only hint extension around existing kill-bounty cap.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` and `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` PASS.
- Follow-up: Add next Game Director experiment candidate (no unchecked backlog items remain).

## 2026-03-20 18:01 KST — Post-RC hazard readability wave 2: overclock risk-tier HUD color
- Task: Color-code overclock RISK tier token in HUD hint (LOW/MED/HIGH).
- Decision: Implemented tier-aware HUD color metadata from hazard module and threaded it through HUD auxiliary hint rendering with fallback color.
- Evidence: ; [PASS] overclock hazard regression validated.
- Follow-up: Queue next Post-RC gameplay/UX experiment candidate.

## 2026-03-20 18:31 KST — P1 hazard readability wave 3: overclock risk-factor breakdown token
- Task: Added compact HUD token "RISK SRC:Dx+DETy+MOVEz" across OVERCLOCK READY/HOT/CD hints.
- Decision: Expose risk component math (discount + detect + move) inline for fast tuning readability without changing hazard mechanics.
- Evidence: luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua; lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua (PASS).
- Follow-up: If HUD width pressure appears in smaller layouts, abbreviate token labels while keeping component values visible.

## 2026-03-20 19:03 KST — Overclock next-pulse ETA HUD token
- Task: Add `NEXT PULSE:<n>s` timing token to overclock READY/CD hint flow for clearer hazard re-entry planning.
- Scope: `src/overclock_hazard.lua`, `scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`, backlog tracking docs.
- Verification: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` and `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` (PASS).
- Follow-up: pick next unchecked Post-RC gameplay readability experiment item.

## 2026-03-20 19:39 KST — DOS HUD compactness check
- Decision: Use terse tokens (`PULSE:%`, `RECHARGE:%`) to preserve single-line DOS readability while adding timing context.
- Constraint: Keep existing risk/bounty legends visible; avoid multiline expansion.
- Follow-up: Validate contrast/scan speed in screenshot refresh cycle.


## 2026-03-20 20:01 KST
- Task: P1 Hazard Readability Wave 6 - overclock risk-trend HUD token (RISK Δ:+n|-n).
- Decision: Kept risk-tier/score static and added state-aware delta signaling (+2 HOT, +1 IMMINENT in-zone cooldown, 0 otherwise) to preserve compact DOS readability.
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` => PASS.
- Follow-up: Consider exposing token color metadata so RISK Δ can mirror rising/neutral/falling pressure semantics in a future wave.
## 2026-03-20 20:33 KST — P1 hazard readability wave 7: overclock zone-presence token
- Completed slice: added `ZONE:IN|OUT` token to overclock HUD hints (READY/HOT/CD/IMMINENT) for immediate hazard-context readability.
- Verification: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` and `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`.
- Follow-up: inject next Game Director experiment candidate (no unchecked backlog items remain).

## 2026-03-20 21:04 KST
- Task context: Overclock hint readability refinement.
- Decision: Added compact `EXPOSED:<n>s` token to preserve DOS single-line threat semantics while improving risk storytelling.
- Follow-up: Validate visual density remains acceptable as hazard hint token count grows.

## 2026-03-20 21:34 KST — Post-RC hazard readability wave 9 (`COMMIT` token)
- Completed item: overclock HUD hints now include `COMMIT:LOW|MID|HIGH` while player is in-zone (`ZONE:IN`), derived from continuous `EXPOSED` duration.
- Decision: commitment tier thresholds fixed at `LOW <5s`, `MID <12s`, `HIGH >=12s` for compact risk readability without tuning gameplay balance.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` and `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` passed.
- Follow-up: if additional unchecked backlog item is needed next cycle, queue next hazard readability experiment candidate.

## 2026-03-20 22:01 KST — Post-RC hazard readability wave 10 follow-up (WINDOW token)
- Task: Add post-pulse relief burst token (`WINDOW:<n>s`) for out-of-zone cooldown readability.
- Scope: `src/overclock_hazard.lua`, `scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Decision: Relief window now arms only when player disengages during HOT and pulse then expires while outside; token is shown only during out-of-zone cooldown and auto-expires.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` (PASS).
- Follow-up: Next unchecked backlog item is overclock dwell-bucket telemetry (`LOW|MID|HIGH`).

## 2026-03-20 22:35 KST — Sync note
- No new visual/UI hierarchy changes in this cycle.
- Telemetry artifacts are ops-facing (`logs/playtests`) and do not alter player-facing layout.

## 2026-03-20 22:41 KST — Game Director ideation snapshot
- Candidate ideas generated:
  1) Run-summary dwell snapshot readability (implemented this cycle)
  2) Reward-efficiency token (`SRL/EXPOSED sec`) in run summary
  3) Multi-run dwell trend combiner artifact for weekly balance review
- Chosen experiment: #1 (low-risk UX readout with immediate tuning utility).

## 2026-03-20 23:03 KST — Run-summary risk/reward readability token
- Added compact post-run token: `OVERCLOCK EFF: <srl> SRL / <sec>s = <ratio> SRL/EXPOSED sec`.
- Decision: display `n/a` when exposure seconds are zero to avoid misleading divide-by-zero output.
- Scope is readability-only; no economy or hazard tuning changed.

## 2026-03-20 23:33 KST — Balance-review readability artifact added
- Added compact markdown trend report (`overclock_dwell_trend.md`) with median dwell mix and included-run ledger.
- Decision: keep report operations-facing to avoid adding active-game UI clutter.

## 2026-03-20 23:36 KST — Game Director Cycle B experiment shipped (`PROFILE` token)
- Idea set generated:
  1) Run-summary commitment profile token (low-risk UX coaching) [chosen]
  2) Dwell-trend volatility token in combiner artifact (mid-risk systems)
  3) Run-summary glossary row for analytics tokens (higher UI clutter risk)
- Implemented vertical slice: `OVERCLOCK PROFILE: CAUTIOUS|BALANCED|ALL-IN` derived from dwell mix thresholds.
- Pass criterion met: token appears in run summary state/render path with deterministic mapping and regression coverage.

## 2026-03-21 00:02 KST — P1 Game Director Cycle B follow-up: overclock dwell volatility token
- Task: Add trend-artifact volatility token (`VOL:STEADY|SWING`) for overclock dwell cadence triage.
- Scope: `scripts/overclock_dwell_trend.py`, `scripts/regression_overclock_dwell_trend.py`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Decision: Classified volatility from run-to-run total-exposure relative deltas (`maxΔ>=45%` or `avgΔ>=30%` => `SWING`; else `STEADY`) to keep signal compact/reversible.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/overclock_dwell_trend.py scripts/regression_overclock_dwell_trend.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_overclock_dwell_trend.py`; `python3 scripts/overclock_dwell_trend.py --runs 3`.
- Follow-up: Remaining unchecked backlog item is `QA/UX Team: run-summary overclock analytics glossary row (DWELL/EFF/PROFILE)`.

## 2026-03-21 00:32 KST — Cross-lane sync: run-summary overclock glossary row
- Synced backlog closure: compact glossary row for run-summary analytics tokens (`DWELL`, `EFF`, `PROFILE`) is now shipped.
- Evidence: `scripts/regression_run_summary.lua` PASS + HUD syntax check PASS.
- No lane-specific balance/system behavior change; readability/documentation-only increment.

## 2026-03-21 00:36 KST — Game Director Cycle C ideation + slice selection
- Generated 3 candidate ideas:
  1) Low-risk UX/game-feel: run-summary `COACH` cue derived from `PROFILE + EFF` for immediate next-run guidance.
  2) Mid-risk systems: threat-linked momentum scaler (`VAR` bonus boost on HIGH threat clears).
  3) High-risk novelty: hazard route tags (`SAFE|RISK|SPIKE`) with mini-callouts.
- Selected experiment #1 for this cycle (small reversible UI guidance slice).
- Follow-up injected tasks remain in `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md` for #2/#3.

## 2026-03-21 01:04 KST — Risk/reward tuning note on momentum scaler prototype
- Design intent: reward skilled objective clears during peak threat windows without changing core objective cadence.
- Guardrail: feature is reversible/env-gated to prevent permanent SRL inflation until telemetry confirms pacing impact.

## 2026-03-21 01:34 KST — Game Director Cycle D idea slate + selection
- Idea slate generated:
  1) Low risk (selected): color-code route mini-callout (`SAFE|RISK|SPIKE`) for instant path-read.
  2) Mid risk: portal-hover `NEXT ROUTE:<tag>` transition preview.
  3) High risk: route-tag distribution checker to prevent one-note map risk profiles.
- Selection rationale: additive, reversible, and directly improves path-planning legibility.

## 2026-03-21 02:06 KST — Transition prompt readability decision
- Added explicit transition modal copy: `PORTAL READY -> ENTER:JUMP  N:CANCEL  NEXT ROUTE:<tag>`.
- Decision: keep prompt compact DOS-style and inject route token directly in confirmation line for low cognitive overhead.
- Fallback token `UNKNOWN` avoids blank-state ambiguity when destination lacks hazard route metadata.

## 2026-03-21 02:31 KST — Game Director Cycle E selection
- Idea slate generated (low/mid/high):
  1) Low-risk UX (selected): route coaching token in portal confirm prompt.
  2) Mid-risk systems: route-tag density ledger by reachable portal graph depth.
  3) High-risk QA/UX: DOS prompt-width budget checker.
- Selected #1 for immediate readability gain with minimal rollback risk.

## 2026-03-21 03:06 KST — Design telemetry readability decision
- Chose depth-bucket ledger format (per start map) to make portal-chain risk texture legible at a glance.
- Kept output compact and artifact-first (`.md` + `.json`) for review without runtime UI clutter.

## 2026-03-21 03:35 KST — Prompt readability budget follow-up
- Shipped compact fallback wording for constrained portal prompt budget: keep action verbs first, then route/coach tokens.
- Added QA follow-up candidate: token-order linter to preserve readability hierarchy (`ACTION -> ROUTE -> COACH/PRESSURE`).

## 2026-03-21 03:36 KST — Cycle G design note
- Added explicit transition-pressure communication at portal decision time to reinforce risk/reward route fantasy.
- Pressure token remains additive/readability-only; no route topology or combat balance mutation in this slice.

## 2026-03-21 04:12 KST — Portal transition prompt token-order linter + budget parser
- Task: QA/Design backlog closure for transition prompt readability order enforcement.
- Scope touched:
  - `src/portal_prompt_linter.lua`
  - `scripts/check_portal_prompt_token_order.lua`
  - `scripts/regression_portal_prompt_token_order.lua`
  - `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Decision: enforce prompt semantic order `ACTION -> ROUTE -> COACH -> PRESSURE` in sampled portal prompt variants and verify budget-selection behavior at configurable char limits.
- Verification: `luac -p src/portal_prompt_linter.lua scripts/check_portal_prompt_token_order.lua scripts/regression_portal_prompt_token_order.lua`, `lua scripts/regression_portal_prompt_token_order.lua`, `lua scripts/check_portal_prompt_token_order.lua`.
- Follow-up: next unchecked item is adaptive portal hint prototype (`ALT ROUTE:<SAFE|RISK|SPIKE>`).

## 2026-03-21 04:34 KST — Portal prompt readability pass (Cycle H)
- Prompt hierarchy retained: ACTION -> ROUTE -> COACH -> PRESSURE, with adaptive suffix `ALT ROUTE` + `ALT DELTA`.
- Compact mode keeps semantic parity via abbreviated `ALT` + `ADEL` tokens.
- Follow-up: QA budget checks should include ALT token combinations under compact constraints.

## 2026-03-21 05:04 KST — Cycle H follow-up: route-aware ALT selector v2
- Completed backlog item: choose adaptive `ALT ROUTE` from lowest-pressure reachable portal branch on current map (not fixed one-step downgrade).
- Verification: [PASS] portal route preview transition prompt regression validated, [PASS] portal prompt compact-mode regression validated, [PASS] portal prompt token-order regression validated, [PASS] portal adaptive ALT selector v2 regression validated (all PASS).
- Follow-up: keep `QA/UX Team: portal prompt readability regression for adaptive ALT token budget/order under HIGH threat compact mode` as next unchecked priority.

## 2026-03-21 05:33 KST — Portal adaptive ALT compact-readability regression
- Decision: Added dedicated regression `scripts/regression_portal_prompt_adaptive_alt_readability.lua` to validate HIGH-threat compact prompt budget + token order with adaptive ALT tokens (`ALT`, `ADEL`).
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_portal_prompt_adaptive_alt_readability.lua` PASS, plus companion prompt regressions PASS.
- Follow-up: Keep this regression in portal readability validation set for future prompt-token changes.

## 2026-03-21 05:38 KST — Game Director Cycle I: ALT PLAN nudge experiment
- Ideas generated: (1) adaptive portal ALT PLAN nudge token (low-risk UX), (2) overclock retreat streak bonus (mid-risk systems), (3) portal readability drift digest automation (high-risk ops novelty).
- Selected experiment: (1) adaptive portal ALT PLAN nudge token for HIGH-pressure transitions.
- Implementation: Added experiment-flagged prompt token in `src/portal.lua` (`ALT PLAN:LOWER RISK` detailed / `AP:LOW` compact) gated by `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_ALT_PLAN_NUDGE`.
- Verification: `lua scripts/regression_portal_prompt_adaptive_alt_readability.lua`, `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_ALT_PLAN_NUDGE=1 lua scripts/regression_portal_alt_plan_nudge.lua`, `lua scripts/regression_portal_prompt_compact_mode.lua`, `lua scripts/regression_portal_prompt_token_order.lua`.
- Follow-up: Monitor readability impact in playtests before promoting flag default.

## 2026-03-21 06:03 KST
- Task: Design consistency check for retreat reward experiment.
- Decision: Kept reward cadence aligned with risk/reward doctrine (only after deliberate safe disengage pattern, not passive cooldown).
- Follow-up: Observe if 2-cycle requirement feels legible without explicit meter before exposing new HUD token.
## 2026-03-21 06:33 KST — Weekly portal prompt readability drift digest shipped
- Completed support for weekly digest artifact: `logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.{md,json}` via `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Added regression coverage: `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Weekly sustain runner now executes digest + regression and reports generated artifacts.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile ...`, digest regression PASS, `bash scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh` PASS.
- Follow-up: use digest trend in upcoming Game Director readability tuning cycles.

## 2026-03-21 06:36 KST — Game Director Cycle J slice (mode-trend token)
- Idea slate generated (low/mid/high risk); selected low-risk readability slice.
- Added `MODE TREND` token to weekly portal prompt drift digest (`COMPACT|DETAILED|BALANCED`).
- Artifacts/regression remain green after update.
- Follow-ups kept in backlog: pressure-band drift token, top-token movers section.


## 2026-03-21 07:01 KST — Game Director Cycle J slice (pressure-band drift token)
- Task: Implement backlog item `PRESSURE BAND:LOW|MID|HIGH` for weekly portal prompt readability digest.
- Decision: Extended `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` to aggregate pressure-token edits (`PRESSURE:` + `P:`) and map net drift to `pressureBand` thresholds (LOW <3, MID 3~7, HIGH >=8 by |net|).
- Evidence: Digest artifacts now include JSON `pressureBand` + `pressureEdits` and markdown line `PRESSURE BAND` with +/-/net counts.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 14 --max-commits 200`.
- Follow-up: Remaining Cycle J item is top-token movers section for digest triage.

## 2026-03-21 07:44 KST — Cycle J follow-up: digest top-token movers shipped
- Completed backlog item: `Design/QA Team: Add digest top-token movers section (largest net ± token deltas) for readability triage`.
- Added per-token edit aggregation (`added/removed/net`) and top-movers ranking in weekly digest outputs.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 14 --max-commits 200` PASS.
- Follow-up: no unchecked items remain in ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC; next cycle should inject new Game Director experiments.

## 2026-03-21 08:03 KST — Game Director Cycle K slice: weekly drift-risk token
- Completed backlog item: `QA/UX Team: Add digest drift-risk token (DRIFT RISK:LOW|MID|HIGH)`.
- Durable decisions:
  - Added `drift_risk_from_signals` classifier in `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` using compact-vs-detailed net imbalance plus pressure-token churn.
  - Weekly digest JSON now exposes `driftRisk` + `driftRiskSignals` (`score`, `imbalance`, `pressureChurn`).
  - Weekly digest markdown now surfaces compact triage line: `DRIFT RISK: <level>`.
- Verification set (PASS):
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`
  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`
  - `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 14 --max-commits 200`
- Follow-up:
  - Remaining Cycle K backlog items: `STICKY TOKENS` persistence token, `FOCUS` lane-focus token.

## 2026-03-21 08:31 KST — Readability triage metric expansion
- Task: Added sticky token signal for weekly readability digest.
- Decision: Treat sticky count as copy-churn smell indicator (re-added/re-removed tokens over time).
- Follow-up: Add lane-focus token to map dominant churn family into actionable design lane.

## 2026-03-21 09:03 KST — Cycle L route-action token vertical slice
- Ideas generated:
  1) Low-risk UX: add digest route-action token (`ROUTE ACTION:*`) from `FOCUS + DRIFT RISK`.
  2) Mid-risk systems: add lane-focus streak metric across windows (`FOCUS STREAK:<n>`).
  3) High-risk novelty: add lane-focus transition handoff token (`FOCUS SHIFT:<FROM->TO>`).
- Chosen experiment: idea #1 (minimal reversible vertical slice).
- Shipped: weekly digest now emits `routeAction` + `routeActionReason` in JSON and `ROUTE ACTION` line in markdown.
- Verification: py_compile PASS, digest regression PASS, live digest regeneration PASS.
- Follow-up: backlog carries remaining Cycle L items (focus streak, focus shift).
## 2026-03-21 09:35 KST — Cycle L close + Cycle M vertical slice
- Completed: Weekly portal prompt digest now includes `FOCUS STREAK:<n>` and `FOCUS SHIFT:<FROM->TO>` signals, then Game Director Cycle M experiment `FOCUS VOL:STEADY|SWING`.
- Decision: Define volatility from non-mixed lane-focus commit sequence switch ratio (`switches/edges`), with `SWING` threshold `>= 0.4`.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120`.
- Follow-up: Cycle M backlog keeps `ACTION CONF` + `ANOMALY` items open.

## 2026-03-21 09:36 KST — Digest readability cue expansion (`ACTION CONF`)
- Task: Surface confidence cue so `ROUTE ACTION` recommendations feel less opaque.
- Decision:
  - Keep confidence compact (`LOW|MID|HIGH`) and show underlying triage hints (`dom`, `spread`, `driftSpread`) inline.
  - Preserve reversibility: no gameplay/runtime change, digest-only signal.
- Evidence:
  - `logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.md` now includes `ACTION CONF` row.
- Commit: `1067216`.
## 2026-03-21 10:03 KST — Cycle M anomaly pulse prototype
- Completed: Added weekly digest anomaly pulse token `ANOMALY:ON|OFF` driven by simultaneous sticky-token and pressure-churn spikes.
- Decision: Use conservative trigger (`sticky >= 3` and `pressureChurn >= 5`) and expose thresholds/signals in JSON + markdown for auditability.
- Evidence: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120`.
- Follow-up: Next highest open item is Cycle N `ANOMALY CONF` tiering to reduce binary alert noise.

## 2026-03-21 10:33 KST — Readability pass: anomaly confidence row
- Completed: markdown digest now includes `ANOMALY CONF` line with compact diagnostics (`triggers`, `gap`).
- UX rationale: operators can gauge anomaly severity without treating every `ANOMALY:ON` equally.
- Follow-up: add lane-lock token for prolonged single-lane drift communication.

## 2026-03-21 11:03 KST — Cycle N follow-up: lane-lock alert token
- Completed backlog item: Add digest lane-lock alert token (LANE LOCK:<lane>x<n>) for prolonged single-lane drift streaks.
- Implementation: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py now emits JSON laneLock/laneLockSignals and markdown LANE LOCK line (NONE when threshold not met; <LANE>x<STREAK> when armed).
- Verification: python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py and weekly digest generation both PASS.
- Follow-up: ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC_BACKLOG now fully checked; next cycle should run Game Director review loop with new experiment injection.

## 2026-03-21 11:31 KST — Cycle O drift-momentum digest slice
- Completed: Added weekly digest token `DRIFT MOMENTUM:RISING|COOLING|FLAT` comparing older-vs-recent commit-window drift scores.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120`.
- Follow-up: Evaluate unchecked Cycle O items (ACTION GUARD, FOCUS ENTROPY) next.

## 2026-03-21 12:03 KST — Digest action policy readability
- Added markdown digest line `ACTION GUARD` to make route-action safety posture explicit.
- Copy format keeps compact triage intent: guard state + reason + upstream risk/confidence pair.
- Decision: default to `SOFT` unless high-risk/low-confidence conjunction arms a hard lock.

## 2026-03-21 12:31 KST — Cycle O close + Cycle P injection (autonomous)
- Completed: Added `FOCUS ENTROPY:LOW|MID|HIGH` token derived from normalized lane-score entropy in weekly portal prompt digest.
- Game Director review cycle:
  1) Low-risk UX idea: `FOCUS BAL:<n>%` lane-dominance readability token.
  2) Mid-risk systems idea: `PRESSURE LAG:FAST|STABLE|SLOW` from pressure churn vs drift momentum.
  3) High-risk novelty idea: `ROUTE SANDBOX:ON` experiment gate when sustained lane lock appears.
- Selected experiment: low-risk `FOCUS BAL:<n>%`.
- Implemented vertical slice: digest JSON/markdown now emits `focusBalance` + `focusBalanceSignals` and markdown `FOCUS BAL` line.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120` PASS.
- Follow-up: Next queued items remain `PRESSURE LAG` and `ROUTE SANDBOX` in TASKS/POST_RC backlog (Cycle P).

## 2026-03-21 13:03 KST — Cycle P pressure-lag digest token
- Completed Post-RC Cycle P item: `PRESSURE LAG:FAST|STABLE|SLOW` in weekly portal prompt readability digest.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120 --out-json logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.json --out-md logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.md`.
- Follow-up: next highest unchecked backlog item is `ROUTE SANDBOX:ON` prototype (flag-gated sustained lane-lock sandbox mode).

## 2026-03-21 13:31 KST — Cycle P route sandbox prototype (weekly digest)
- Added experiment-gated digest token  via  with sustained lane-lock arming requirement.
- Verified regression and digest generation remain PASS ([PASS] weekly portal prompt readability drift regression checks, digest script run).
- Follow-up: keep flag OFF by default; enable only for controlled sandbox reviews.

## 2026-03-21 13:31 KST — Cycle P route sandbox prototype (weekly digest)
- Added experiment-gated digest token ROUTE SANDBOX:ON|OFF via DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_ROUTE_SANDBOX with sustained lane-lock arming requirement.
- Verified regression and digest generation remain PASS (`python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, digest script run).
- Follow-up: keep flag OFF by default; enable only for controlled sandbox reviews.

## 2026-03-21 14:33 KST — Cycle Q sandbox cooloff token
- Completed backlog item: `SANDBOX COOLOFF:<n>` (consecutive non-armed windows since last `ROUTE SANDBOX:ON`).
- Evidence:
  - `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now computes `sandboxCooloff` + `sandboxCooloffSignals` from prior digest JSON and emits markdown line `SANDBOX COOLOFF`.
  - `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` extended for payload/schema/markdown assertions and cooloff transition fixtures (`no prior`, `just disarmed`, `continuing`).
  - Fresh digest artifacts regenerated under `logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.{json,md}`.
- Verification:
  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
- Follow-up: remaining unchecked Cycle Q item is `SANDBOX TARGET:<lane>` token.

## 2026-03-21 15:01 KST — Game Director Cycle Q sandbox target token
- Decision: Added digest routing token `SANDBOX TARGET:<lane>` to explicitly pin the lane family to test when route sandbox is active.
- Rationale: `ROUTE SANDBOX`/`PLAN` showed activation state but not the concrete lane target for design triage handoff.
- Implementation notes: weekly digest markdown now prints `SANDBOX TARGET` line with lane-lock context (`lane`, `armed`, `streak`).
- Follow-up: If sandbox turns ON in live windows, use target lane to open focused probe checklist before broader balance pass.

## 2026-03-21 15:01 KST — Cycle R idea selection and handoff readability
- Generated 3 ideas (low/mid/high risk) for route-sandbox follow-up.
- Chosen experiment: `SANDBOX TARGET CONF` token to indicate lane-target handoff reliability.
- Player-facing intent: reduce ambiguity when deciding whether to run lane-specific probes.

## 2026-03-21 15:33 KST — Cycle R sandbox target source token
- Completed backlog item: `TARGET SRC:LOCK|MIXED|NONE` for weekly portal prompt readability drift digest.
- Decision: expose derivation path directly from sandbox-target resolver (`LOCK` when lane-lock derived, `MIXED` when sandbox active without single-lane lock, `NONE` when sandbox inactive) for quick auditability.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits `sandboxTargetSource` in JSON, adds `targetSource` signal, and renders markdown line `TARGET SRC`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; digest regeneration PASS.
- Follow-up: next highest unchecked item is `TARGET SHIFT:<FROM->TO>` history token.

## 2026-03-21 15:38 KST — Cycle R closure: sandbox target history token
- Completed remaining Cycle R backlog item: `TARGET SHIFT:<FROM->TO>` in weekly portal prompt readability digest.
- Digest now emits JSON fields `sandboxTargetShift`, `sandboxTargetShiftSignals` and markdown row `TARGET SHIFT`.
- Shift semantics compare prior digest `sandboxTarget` to current target; emits stable `X->X` when unchanged and still reports prior-load/change signals for auditability.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120 ...` PASS.

## 2026-03-21 16:01 KST — Cycle S digest readability triage token
- Decision: Introduced explicit readiness tier (`SANDBOX READY`) so route-sandbox go/no-go can be parsed at a glance in markdown digest summaries.
- Evidence: Weekly digest markdown now includes `SANDBOX READY` line with reason and contributing signals.
- Follow-up: pair with action-stability token for fewer ambiguous routing recommendations.

## 2026-03-21 16:33 KST — Cycle S digest stability token (`ACTION STABILITY`)
- Task: Add `ACTION STABILITY:LOCKED|WATCH` derived from `ACTION CONF + FOCUS VOL + DRIFT MOMENTUM` to reduce retune whiplash.
- Decision: Classified as `LOCKED` only when confidence is MID/HIGH, focus volatility is STEADY, and drift momentum is FLAT/COOLING; otherwise `WATCH`.
- Evidence:
  - Updated `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` with `route_action_stability_from_signals`, JSON fields (`actionStability`, `actionStabilitySignals`), and markdown digest line.
  - Extended `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` assertions for new schema + markdown token.
  - Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS), `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120` (PASS).
- Follow-up: Remaining highest-priority unchecked item is Cycle S `WHAT-IF ALT:<lane> ΔRISK:<n>` experiment behind flag.

## 2026-03-21 17:01 KST — Cycle S flagged experiment closure (`WHAT-IF ALT`)
- Completed highest-priority open item by shipping `WHAT-IF ALT:<lane> ΔRISK:<n>` as a flag-gated digest token.
- Durable decision: keep token non-invasive (`OFF` by default) and include both projected/baseline risk in markdown context for auditability.
- Next review hook: all ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC checklist items are now checked; next cron should enter Game Director ideation cycle immediately.

## 2026-03-21 17:31 KST
- Task: Added readability token `WHAT-IF CONF` to weekly digest markdown.
- Decision: Keep compact explanatory diagnostics (`delta`, `routeConf`, lanes) on one line for triage speed.
- Follow-up: design semantics for `WHAT-IF ALIGN` token (`ALIGNED|DIVERGED`).

## 2026-03-21 18:01 KST — Cycle T what-if alignment token
- Completed: Added digest token `WHAT-IF ALIGN:ALIGNED|DIVERGED` derived from `ALT LANE` vs `ROUTE ACTION` mapping.
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Follow-up: implement remaining Cycle T item `WHAT-IF BAND:GAIN|NEUTRAL|LOSS`.

## 2026-03-21 18:31 KST — Cycle U digest readability sizing (`WHAT-IF MAG`)
- Added compact token `WHAT-IF MAG:SMALL|MED|LARGE` to summarize alternate-lane impact magnitude without reading full delta tuple.
- Readability contract: keep `WHAT-IF BAND` (directional outcome) and `WHAT-IF MAG` (impact size) as separate lines to avoid overloaded labels.
- Follow-up: define `WHAT-IF FIT:SAFE|EVEN|TENSE` semantics against pressure-band context.

## 2026-03-21 19:03 KST — Digest readability semantics update
- Added pressure-context fit tier (`SAFE|EVEN|TENSE`) so what-if delta is interpreted against current pressure conditions, not delta alone.
- Rationale: keeps route-planning token semantics glanceable during mixed-risk weeks.

## 2026-03-21 19:33 KST — Cycle U what-if fallback token (`WHAT-IF FALLBACK`) shipped
- Completed backlog item: prototype `WHAT-IF FALLBACK:<lane>` behind flag when what-if alternate lane diverges from route action.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits `whatIfFallback` + `whatIfFallbackSignals` and markdown line `WHAT-IF FALLBACK`.
- Flag contract: `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_FALLBACK` (OFF by default). When enabled + `WHAT-IF ALIGN:DIVERGED`, fallback resolves to route-action lane (`PORTAL|ALT|PRESSURE`), otherwise `NONE`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120 --out-json logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.json --out-md logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.md`.
- Follow-up: All ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC items are checked; next cycle should run Game Director review loop (3 ideas -> 1 experiment -> slice).

## 2026-03-21 19:36 KST — Game Director Cycle V (ideas + selected vertical slice)
- Candidate ideas:
  1) Low-risk UX: `WHAT-IF FALLBACK CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` from fallback divergence + route confidence.
  2) Mid-risk systems: `WHAT-IF FALLBACK FIT:SAFE|EVEN|TENSE` from fallback projection vs pressure band.
  3) High-risk novelty: flagged fallback rationale token `WHAT-IF FALLBACK WHY:<short>` for operator-facing diagnostics.
- Selected experiment: idea (1) fallback confidence token (minimal reversible slice).
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits `whatIfFallbackConfidence` + signals and markdown `WHAT-IF FALLBACK CONF`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 120 --out-json logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.json --out-md logs/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.md`.
- Backlog update: Added Cycle V queue to `TASKS.md`/`POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`, marked fallback-confidence item done, left fallback-fit + fallback-why queued.

- Follow-up: remaining Cycle V unchecked item is `WHAT-IF FALLBACK WHY:<short>` behind flag.

## 2026-03-21 20:34 KST
- Task: Prototype what-if fallback rationale token (`WHAT-IF FALLBACK WHY:<short>`) behind experiment flag.
- Decision: Added concise rationale classifier gated by `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_FALLBACK_WHY` with short operator-facing labels (`RISK-DROP`, `CONF-LOW`, `PRESSURE`, etc.) and kept default output stable as `OFF` when flag-disabled.
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, backlog trackers.
- Follow-up: If enabled in ops, tune rationale vocabulary from weekly digest review feedback.

## 2026-03-21 21:01 KST — Cycle W sync note
- Cross-lane acknowledgment: shipped digest token `WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALIGN:SYNC|ASYNC` for fallback-vs-focus routing coherence.
- Impact: telemetry/readability only; no gameplay/economy/map balance changes.
- Verification reference: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.
- Next hook: continue Cycle W queued items (`WHAT-IF FALLBACK MAG`, `WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALT2`).

## 2026-03-21 21:35 KST — Digest readability update (fallback planning)
- Added explicit rollback impact sizing token: `WHAT-IF FALLBACK MAG`.
- Added optional secondary path preview token: `WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALT2` (flag-gated).
- Copy kept compact in existing token stack to preserve DOS digest scanability.

## 2026-03-21 21:58 KST — Dual-path readability refinement
- Task: stabilize `WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALT2` so secondary path is only shown when lane ranking is meaningful.
- UX rationale: hide weak/coin-flip secondary suggestions to avoid over-coaching noise in digest review.
- Outcome: quality-gated ALT2 with explicit diagnostic reasons retained in JSON/markdown signals.

## 2026-03-21 22:04 KST — Cycle X vertical slice closure (`WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALT2 CONF`)
- Completed highest-priority unchecked item by adding `WHAT-IF FALLBACK ALT2 CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` after `ALT2` token in markdown digest.
- UX rule: confidence is LOW unless the secondary lane is actionable and quality-gate signals are strong enough to trust.
- Next hook: remaining backlog item is dual-path merge hint (`WHAT-IF FALLBACK PLAN`).

## 2026-03-21 22:33:50 KST
- Task: Completed compact strategy token design `WHAT-IF FALLBACK PLAN:PRIMARY|SECONDARY|HOLD`.
- Decision: Keep tri-state wording terse for DOS digest readability and operator handoff speed.

- Completed backlog item: added flagged dual-route split recommendation token `WHAT-IF SPLIT:ON|OFF` in weekly portal readability digest.
- Decision: gate behind `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT`; emit `ON` only when primary/secondary fallback lanes are both actionable, diverged, and pass confidence + |ΔRISK| threshold.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
- Follow-up: with TASKS + POST_RC backlog now fully checked, next cycle should start Game Director review loop (3 ideas -> pick 1 -> minimal vertical slice).

## 2026-03-21 23:36 KST — Game Director Cycle Z review + selected vertical slice
- Idea set:
  1) Low-risk UX: `WHAT-IF SPLIT CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` trust token for split recommendation.

- Follow-up: inject fresh Game Director ideas now that queue is fully checked.

## 2026-03-22 01:01 KST — Game Director Cycle AA: split posture vertical slice
- Backlog lifecycle: set `WHAT-IF SPLIT POSTURE` to `[~]` before implementation, then promoted to `[x]` after verification in `TASKS.md` + `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Idea slate generated:
  1) Low-risk UX (chosen): `WHAT-IF SPLIT POSTURE:SAFE|WATCH|HOLD`.
  2) Mid-risk systems: `WHAT-IF SPLIT COOLOFF:<n>` counter.
  3) High-risk novelty: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESCALATE:ON`.
- Implemented minimal vertical slice in `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`:
  - Added `what_if_split_posture_from_signals(...)`.
  - Added JSON fields `whatIfSplitPosture` + `whatIfSplitPostureSignals`.
  - Added markdown digest row `WHAT-IF SPLIT POSTURE`.
- Regression updates: `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now asserts new schema keys + markdown token.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
- Next hook: implement Cycle AA follow-ups (`SPLIT COOLOFF`, `SPLIT ESCALATE`).


## 2026-03-22 01:35 KST — Cycle AA follow-up closure (`WHAT-IF SPLIT COOLOFF`)
- Completed backlog item: added `WHAT-IF SPLIT COOLOFF:<n>` token to weekly portal readability digest.
- Decision: cooloff starts at 1 when split flips ON->OFF, increments while split stays OFF, resets to 0 on split ON.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` passed.
- Follow-up: next unchecked item is flagged novelty `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESCALATE:ON`.

## 2026-03-22 02:03 KST
- Task: Digest readability pass for new split escalation token.
- Decision: Keep compact token label `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESCALATE` with concise reason + gate context (flag/split/divergence/fit) to match existing digest style.
- Follow-up: monitor token-line width in future copy-budget lint wave.

## 2026-03-22 02:12 KST
- Game Director Cycle AB ideation:
  1) Low-risk UX token: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC CONF` (confidence readability for escalation sentinel) — Scope S, rollback: remove token line.
  2) Mid-risk systems token: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC LANES` (explicit escalation route pair) — Scope S/M, rollback: fallback to existing split lanes token.
  3) High-risk novelty token: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC COOL` (post-escalation cooloff pressure memory) — Scope M, rollback: flag OFF.
- Selected experiment this cycle: Idea #1 (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC CONF`) for minimal vertical slice.
- Pass criterion: digest JSON/MD include new token + regression stays green.

## 2026-03-22 02:36 KST
- Task: Cycle AB follow-up closure — split escalation readability/cooloff tokens (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC LANES`, `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC COOL`).
- Files: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅, `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 30 --max-commits 50 --out-json /tmp/dotpio-weekly.json --out-md /tmp/dotpio-weekly.md` ✅.
- Decisions: Added explicit escalation route-pair token `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC LANES:<primary>/<secondary>`; added flag-gated escalation cooloff counter `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC COOL:<n>` (`DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_COOL`) with OFF->disarm lifecycle tracking from prior digest payload.
- Follow-up: ACTION_ITEMS has only tracking legend `- [ ] todo` remaining; next meaningful priority is to continue digest Game Director line when new actionable items are injected.

## 2026-03-22 03:04 KST — Game Director Cycle AC vertical slice closure (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE`)
- Task: Add split escalation lifecycle state token for weekly portal prompt digest triage.
- Ideas generated:
  1) Low-risk UX (selected): `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE:ARMED|COOLING|IDLE`.
  2) Mid-risk systems: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC PRESSURE:LOW|MID|HIGH` cooldown pressure band.
  3) High-risk novelty: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane>` post-escalation recovery route hint.
- Decision: Ship idea #1 as minimal vertical slice and inject #2/#3 as follow-up backlog candidates.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits JSON fields `whatIfSplitEscState` + `whatIfSplitEscStateSignals` and markdown line `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE`.
- Verification:
  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 60` ✅
- Backlog lifecycle: marked Cycle AC state-token item `[~] -> [x]` in `TASKS.md` and `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`; follow-up items remain unchecked.
- Next hook: implement Cycle AC mid/high experiments (`ESC PRESSURE`, `ESC RECOVER`) in subsequent loop.

## 2026-03-22 03:31 KST — Cycle AC follow-up: split escalation cooldown pressure-band token
- Completed task: Add  behind .
- Decision: token defaults to  with explicit  reason; when enabled, pressure derives from current pressure band with lifecycle-aware cooling decay (=base,  decays 1~2 steps,  minimized).
- Verification: py_compile + [PASS] weekly portal prompt readability drift regression checks + digest generation PASS.
- Next: implement remaining Cycle AC item  behind flag.

## 2026-03-22 03:33 KST — Cycle AC follow-up: split escalation cooldown pressure-band token (corrected log)
- Completed task: Add `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC PRESSURE:LOW|MID|HIGH` behind `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_PRESSURE`.
- Decision: token defaults to `LOW` with explicit `flag-disabled` reason; when enabled, pressure derives from current pressure band with lifecycle-aware cooling decay (`ARMED`=base, `COOLING` decays 1~2 steps, `IDLE` minimized).
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + weekly digest generation PASS.
- Next: implement remaining Cycle AC item `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane>` behind flag.

## 2026-03-22 03:41 KST — Game Director Cycle AD vertical slice: split escalation recovery hint
- Idea slate (L/M/H): (1) recovery hint lane token (chosen), (2) recovery confidence token, (3) dual-lane recovery fallback token.
- Shipped: weekly digest now emits WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane> behind DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER; when enabled it suggests the lowest-pressure actionable lane from escalation lane-pair, otherwise OFF/NONE with explicit reason.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md.
- Verification: python3 -m py_compile + python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py + digest generation PASS.
- Backlog sync: Cycle AC recovery item closed; Cycle AD injected with recovery-confidence + recovery-alt follow-ups.

## 2026-03-22 04:01 KST — Cycle AD: Split Escalation Recovery Confidence
- Completed: Added WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH token derived from recovery lane availability, escalation lifecycle state, lane divergence, and pressure easing context.
- Decision: Confidence stays LOW when recover route is OFF/NONE or state is ARMED; rises to MID/HIGH only during easing (COOLING/IDLE) with actionable/divergent lanes and manageable pressure.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md
- Verification: python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py (PASS); python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py (PASS).
- Next: Implement WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ALT:<lane> prototype behind flag for contingency planning.

## 2026-03-22 04:33 KST — HUD/digest readability decision
- Added explicit markdown line `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ALT` adjacent to RECOVER + RECOVER CONF for triage continuity.
- Kept token naming compact and parallel with existing `ESC` family for scan speed.
