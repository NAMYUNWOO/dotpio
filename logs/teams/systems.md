- Task: M0 pickup flow baseline (`G` key on player tile) with world-item consume and inventory-capacity guard.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Files: `main.lua`, `src/entities.lua`, `ACTION_ITEMS.md`, `TASKS.md`
- Verification: `luac -p main.lua src/entities.lua` (pass)
- Decisions:
  - Added `Entities.itemAt()` + `Entities.removeItem()` to keep pickup logic centralized.
  - Implemented pickup in `love.keypressed` (`g`) and route status messaging through `InventoryUI.setStatus`.
  - On successful pickup, item is flagged collected and removed from entity list to prevent duplicate pickup.
- Follow-up:
  - Add HUD/help hint for `G:Pickup` (M0 UX item).
  - Add explicit regression scenario for drop→pickup count validation.
