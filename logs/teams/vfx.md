# VFX Team Log


## 2026-03-22 15:41 KST — Cycle AQ kickoff (first VFX lane shipment)
- Forced-lane experiment delivered to satisfy cadence gap: added portal transition FX intensity cue tied to route pressure.
- Token contract:
  - `FX:CALM` for low pressure,
  - `FX:FLICKER` for mid pressure,
  - `FX:SURGE` for high pressure,
  - compact fallback `FX:C|F|S`.
- Scope: text-mode VFX language only (no mechanical/stat changes), fully reversible.
- Verification: portal prompt regression suite PASS.
- Next VFX candidate queued: combat pressure pulse token (`BERSERK FX:PULSE`) for sustained rising threat.
