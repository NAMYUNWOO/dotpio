## 2026-03-20 00:26 KST — map_03~07 silhouette/encounter redesign pass
- Decision: Added explicit map metadata on map_03~07 (`silhouette`, `laneStructure`, `encounterRhythm`) to lock each map's tactical identity and make future tuning auditable.
- Change: Attached per-map `encounterProfile` knobs (enemy count multiplier + variant bias) to support rhythm differentiation without breaking portal topology.
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_map_profile_distinctness.lua`, `python3 scripts/validate_portals.py`, `python3 scripts/regression_map_progression.py`.

- Task: Reposition map_03~07 portals to enforce landmark-based traversal and clearer return/risk routing.
- Decision:
  - map_03 now anchors exits at distinct landmarks (west-upper return to map_02, north apex to map_04, east-south fallback to map_01).
  - map_04 mirrors hinge logic with south return to map_03, west fallback to map_01, east-overlook push into map_05.
  - map_05~07 chain portals shifted off corner clumping to clearer lane landmarks while preserving bidirectional links.
- Files: `maps/map_03.lua`, `maps/map_04.lua`, `maps/map_05.lua`, `maps/map_06.lua`, `maps/map_07.lua`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`

- Decision: Overclock status hint now includes live seconds for active pulse (`OVERCLOCK HOT <n>s`) and cooldown (`OVERCLOCK CD <n>s`) to reduce timing ambiguity.
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua`.
- Follow-up: Consider mirroring countdown near build preview panel for players who open inventory during hazard pulses.

## 2026-03-20 14:00 KST — Sustain dashboard regression-risk driver breakdown
- Decision: Added `regressionRisk.topDrivers` (top 3 contributors) to dashboard payload and markdown so ops reviews can immediately see what is driving score changes.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py`; `python3 scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py --format json --pretty`.
- Follow-up: If risk repeatedly trends WARN/ALERT, add automated recommendation mapping each driver to a concrete remediation runbook step.

## 2026-03-20 14:29 KST — Overclock hazard HUD risk-tier readability
- Reviewed map-driven overclock metadata usage in runtime HUD hint path.
- Decision: keep map metadata schema unchanged; compute readable risk tier from existing hazard knobs (discount + detect bonus + move pressure) to avoid map migration overhead.
- Follow-up: if multiple hazard archetypes ship, consider per-map explicit risk override for authored pacing.

## 2026-03-20 14:56 KST — overclock aggro-pressure legend follow-up
- Task: Add active-pulse HUD hint legend for overclock aggro pressure (`AGGRO DET:+n MOVE:+m%`).

- Decision: Keep warning scoped to in-zone state + final 3 seconds only to avoid HUD noise outside risk context.
- Follow-up: Validate threshold feel in playtest; tune 3s window if players still miss pulse timing.

## 2026-03-20 16:55 KST — Hazard reward follow-up
- Added map-authored overclock reward knobs in `map_07` metadata (`killBonusPerKill=1`, `killBonusPulseCap=3`) to keep reward tuning local to hazard content.
- No geometry/portal changes.

## 2026-03-20 17:31 KST — Overclock next-pulse bounty budget readability
- Decision: READY/CD overclock HUD hints now include `NEXT BOUNTY:0/y` so players can pre-plan hot-zone reward windows before pulse activation.

- Decision: Kept risk-tier/score static and added state-aware delta signaling (+2 HOT, +1 IMMINENT in-zone cooldown, 0 otherwise) to preserve compact DOS readability.
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` => PASS.
- Follow-up: Consider exposing token color metadata so RISK Δ can mirror rising/neutral/falling pressure semantics in a future wave.
## 2026-03-20 20:33 KST — P1 hazard readability wave 7: overclock zone-presence token
- Completed slice: added `ZONE:IN|OUT` token to overclock HUD hints (READY/HOT/CD/IMMINENT) for immediate hazard-context readability.

- Decision: commitment tier thresholds fixed at `LOW <5s`, `MID <12s`, `HIGH >=12s` for compact risk readability without tuning gameplay balance.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` and `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` passed.
- Follow-up: if additional unchecked backlog item is needed next cycle, queue next hazard readability experiment candidate.

## 2026-03-20 21:42 KST — P1 hazard readability wave 10 (`RISK Δ` color semantics)
- Completed item: hazard hint color now reacts to delta state via `OverclockHazard.getHudHintColor` (delta>0 red, delta<0 green, otherwise tier color).
- Decision: out-of-zone cooldown now emits `RISK Δ:-1` to communicate safe disengage timing after overclock pulse.
- Evidence: `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` + `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`.
- Follow-up: evaluate adding a compact post-pulse relief window token for stronger retreat/re-engage rhythm.

- Scope: `src/overclock_hazard.lua`, `scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Decision: Relief window now arms only when player disengages during HOT and pulse then expires while outside; token is shown only during out-of-zone cooldown and auto-expires.
- Evidence: `luac -p src/overclock_hazard.lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua`; `lua scripts/regression_overclock_hazard.lua` (PASS).
- Follow-up: Next unchecked backlog item is overclock dwell-bucket telemetry (`LOW|MID|HIGH`).

- Added map metadata route tag on hazard map (`maps/map_07.lua`): `routeTag = "SPIKE"`.
- Exposed route-tag API via hazard runtime (`getRouteTag`, `getRouteCallout`).
- Follow-up: backfill route tags on additional hazard maps once portal-preview token experiment lands.

## 2026-03-21 02:06 KST — Portal jump now previews target route profile
- Portal interaction now surfaces target-map route profile before jump confirmation.
- Route tag resolves from destination map metadata (`overclockHazard.routeTag`) and falls back to `UNKNOWN` when absent.

- Follow-up remains metadata expansion across more hazard-enabled maps for broader profile spread.

## 2026-03-21 03:35 KST — Portal prompt compact fallback shipped
- Completed Cycle F selected experiment: portal transition prompt now supports compact fallback copy when a strict budget is requested.
- Runtime contract: detailed prompt stays default (`NEXT ROUTE:<tag> COACH:<phrase>`), constrained mode returns compact tokenized copy (`NEXT:<tag> COACH:<short>`).
- Scope kept reversible and UI-only (no portal routing/mechanics changes).

## 2026-03-21 03:36 KST — Cycle G world lane note
- No map layout or portal graph rewiring in this cycle.
- World-facing change is metadata consumption only: destination `routeTag` now contributes to transition pressure scoring.

- Task: Route-lane divergence signal handoff check for split escalation sentinel.
- Decision: Reuse existing lane divergence signals from weekly portal digest (no map/portal data model changes required).
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-22 02:36 KST
- Task: Cycle AB follow-up closure — split escalation readability/cooloff tokens (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC LANES`, `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC COOL`).
- Files: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅, `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 30 --max-commits 50 --out-json /tmp/dotpio-weekly.json --out-md /tmp/dotpio-weekly.md` ✅.
- Decisions: Added explicit escalation route-pair token `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC LANES:<primary>/<secondary>`; added flag-gated escalation cooloff counter `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC COOL:<n>` (`DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_COOL`) with OFF->disarm lifecycle tracking from prior digest payload.
- Follow-up: ACTION_ITEMS has only tracking legend `- [ ] todo` remaining; next meaningful priority is to continue digest Game Director line when new actionable items are injected.

## 2026-03-22 03:04 KST — Game Director Cycle AC vertical slice closure (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE`)
- Task: Add split escalation lifecycle state token for weekly portal prompt digest triage.
- Ideas generated:
  1) Low-risk UX (selected): `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE:ARMED|COOLING|IDLE`.
  2) Mid-risk systems: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC PRESSURE:LOW|MID|HIGH` cooldown pressure band.
  3) High-risk novelty: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane>` post-escalation recovery route hint.
- Decision: Ship idea #1 as minimal vertical slice and inject #2/#3 as follow-up backlog candidates.
- Implementation: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` now emits JSON fields `whatIfSplitEscState` + `whatIfSplitEscStateSignals` and markdown line `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC STATE`.
- Verification:
  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py --since-days 7 --max-commits 60` ✅
- Backlog lifecycle: marked Cycle AC state-token item `[~] -> [x]` in `TASKS.md` and `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`; follow-up items remain unchecked.
- Next hook: implement Cycle AC mid/high experiments (`ESC PRESSURE`, `ESC RECOVER`) in subsequent loop.

## 2026-03-22 03:31 KST — Cycle AC follow-up: split escalation cooldown pressure-band token
- Completed task: Add  behind .
- Decision: token defaults to  with explicit  reason; when enabled, pressure derives from current pressure band with lifecycle-aware cooling decay (=base,  decays 1~2 steps,  minimized).
- Verification: py_compile + [PASS] weekly portal prompt readability drift regression checks + digest generation PASS.
- Next: implement remaining Cycle AC item  behind flag.

## 2026-03-22 03:33 KST — Cycle AC follow-up: split escalation cooldown pressure-band token (corrected log)
- Completed task: Add `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC PRESSURE:LOW|MID|HIGH` behind `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_PRESSURE`.
- Decision: token defaults to `LOW` with explicit `flag-disabled` reason; when enabled, pressure derives from current pressure band with lifecycle-aware cooling decay (`ARMED`=base, `COOLING` decays 1~2 steps, `IDLE` minimized).
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + weekly digest generation PASS.
- Next: implement remaining Cycle AC item `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane>` behind flag.

## 2026-03-22 03:41 KST — Game Director Cycle AD vertical slice: split escalation recovery hint
- Idea slate (L/M/H): (1) recovery hint lane token (chosen), (2) recovery confidence token, (3) dual-lane recovery fallback token.
- Shipped: weekly digest now emits WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER:<lane> behind DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER; when enabled it suggests the lowest-pressure actionable lane from escalation lane-pair, otherwise OFF/NONE with explicit reason.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md.
- Verification: python3 -m py_compile + python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py + digest generation PASS.
- Backlog sync: Cycle AC recovery item closed; Cycle AD injected with recovery-confidence + recovery-alt follow-ups.

## 2026-03-22 04:01 KST — Cycle AD: Split Escalation Recovery Confidence
- Completed: Added WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH token derived from recovery lane availability, escalation lifecycle state, lane divergence, and pressure easing context.
- Decision: Confidence stays LOW when recover route is OFF/NONE or state is ARMED; rises to MID/HIGH only during easing (COOLING/IDLE) with actionable/divergent lanes and manageable pressure.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md
- Verification: python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py (PASS); python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py (PASS).
- Next: Implement WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ALT:<lane> prototype behind flag for contingency planning.

## 2026-03-22 04:33 KST — Route fallback ordering reused
- Recovery ALT fallback honors existing route pressure ordering (`PORTAL` safest baseline, then `ALT`, then `PRESSURE`) for consistent post-escalation routing behavior.
- No map/portal topology changes required this cycle.

## 2026-03-22 04:41 KST — Cycle AE update
- Injected Game Director Cycle AE slate (3 ideas), shipped selected vertical slice: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ALT CONF`.
- Verification references: weekly portal readability regression + digest generation passed.
- Remaining Cycle AE queue: `RECOVER PLAN`, flagged `RECOVER WHY`.

## 2026-03-22 05:04 KST — No world-map changes (Cycle AE systems slice)
- This cycle touched digest routing telemetry only; no map/portal topology updates required.

## 2026-03-22 05:34 KST — Cycle AE closure (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER WHY`)
- Completed task: Prototype `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER WHY:<short>` behind `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER_WHY`.
- Shipped in weekly digest pipeline with deterministic short rationale states (`FLAG OFF`, `PRIMARY RELIEF`, `PRIMARY STABILIZE`, `PRIMARY STEADY`, `ALT SAFETY NET`, `ALT CONTINGENCY`, `HOLD FOR SIGNAL`).
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` passed.
- Follow-up: all ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC_BACKLOG currently checked; next cycle should run Game Director ideation/injection lane.

## 2026-03-22 05:38 KST — Game Director Cycle AF review + vertical slice
- Idea slate (3):
  1) Low-risk UX (selected): `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER TEMPO:FAST|STEADY|DEFER` (Scope S, rollback: remove digest row).
  2) Mid-risk systems: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ΔCONF:+n|-n` (Scope M, rollback: drop prior-window diff state).
  3) High-risk novelty: flag-gated `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON` under HIGH pressure + LOW confidence (Scope M/L, rollback: flag OFF).
- Selected experiment: #1 tempo token as minimal vertical slice.
- Implementation: weekly digest now emits JSON fields `whatIfSplitEscRecoverTempo` + `whatIfSplitEscRecoverTempoSignals` and markdown line `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER TEMPO`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` pass.
- Backlog injection: added Cycle AF entries to `TASKS.md` and `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md` with selected slice done and two follow-up candidates queued.

## 2026-03-22 06:12 KST — Cycle AF follow-up: split escalation recovery confidence delta
- Completed: Added `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER ΔCONF:+n|-n` token by comparing current recovery confidence tier against prior digest window.
- Decision: Use ordinal confidence scoring (`LOW=0`, `MID=1`, `HIGH=2`) and emit signed delta (`+n` / `-n`, zero as `+0`) with explicit `priorLoaded` signal for auditability.
- Files: scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py, TASKS.md, POST_RC_BACKLOG.md
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS), `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS)
- Next: implement flagged `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON` sentinel when pressure remains HIGH under low confidence.

## 2026-03-22 06:31 KST — Cycle AF/AG digest follow-up
- Task: Closed remaining Cycle AF unchecked item (`WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON`) and executed Game Director review cycle because ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC were fully checked.
- Commit: pending (this run)
- Files: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `TASKS.md`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added flag-gated veto sentinel `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO:ON|OFF` (`DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_WHAT_IF_SPLIT_ESC_RECOVER_VETO`) for HIGH-pressure + LOW-confidence recovery contexts.
  - Ran Game Director cycle ideas (low/mid/high), selected low-risk UX slice, and shipped `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` for trust readability.
  - Injected Cycle AG backlog follow-ups (`VETO WHY`, `VETO COOLOFF`) as next queue items.
- Follow-up:
  - Highest-priority unchecked item now: `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO WHY:<short>` (flag-gated).

## [2026-03-22 07:05 KST] Cycle AG - split escalation veto rationale/cooloff tokens

- Ideation (3): (1) veto state token (low-risk UX), (2) veto dwell token (mid-risk telemetry), (3) veto release cue token (high-risk novelty copy).
- Picked experiment: veto state token (`ARMED|COOLING|IDLE`) as minimal vertical slice.
- Verification: weekly portal digest regression pass with markdown/token assertions and state-signal unit checks.

## 2026-03-22 07:33 KST — Cycle AH follow-up: veto dwell token
- Task: Add `WHAT-IF SPLIT ESC RECOVER VETO DWELL:<n>` to count consecutive `ARMED` windows.
- Decision: Dwell increments only when current+prior veto state are both `ARMED`; resets to `0` on `COOLING/IDLE` to avoid stale streak carry.
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`, `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` PASS.

- Ideas generated (3): (1) suppression-scene confidence cue, (2) combat/ux warning token prototype, (3) ai-content/world narrative microline prototype.
- Selected/implemented: Idea 1, adding PULSE REMAP SCENE CONF (LOW|MED|HIGH) as an offline digest cue with payload signals and markdown rows.
- Verification: python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py (PASS).
- Backlog injection: added two new unchecked follow-ups for Combat/UX and AI Content/World in TASKS.md + POST_RC_BACKLOG.md.

## 2026-03-25 23:01 KST — World readability handoff note
- Suppression posture warning token positioned as cross-lane handoff cue so world-facing scene flavor rows can stay narrative-focused.
- No map/portal graph changes required; this cycle is telemetry/readability-only.
- Follow-up dependency: scene-reactive narrative microline generator should reference posture signal without replacing scene flavor token.

## 2026-03-25 23:34 KST — World-facing microline readability pass
- Added narrative microline layer that references suppression cadence memory without changing runtime world mapping.
- Microline stays additive to `PULSE REMAP SCENE` + `PULSE REMAP SCENE CONF`, preserving existing scene flavor readability contract.

## 2026-03-26 00:01 KST — Cycle DT
- Game Director cycle executed after ACTION_ITEMS/TASKS/POST_RC actionable queue reached full-check state.
- Injected Cycle DT ideas (low/mid/high) and selected low-risk Combat/UX vertical slice: `PULSE REMAP SCENE MICROLINE CADENCE`.
- Verification target: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Follow-up queue preserved in backlog: `PRSMC FAMILY TREND` (Systems/QA) and dual-line microline variant pack (AI Content/World).

## 2026-03-26 00:36 KST
- Completed Cycle DT Systems/QA slice: added `PRSMC FAMILY TREND` prior-window drift coverage in weekly digest (`scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`) and regression lock (`scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`).
- Decision: track `pulseRemapSceneMicrolineCadenceAlias` family net drift with the same triage contract used by PRMS/PRSP (`trend/currentNet/priorNet/priorLoaded/reason`) for operator parity.
- Follow-up: remaining unchecked item is AI Content/World dual-line microline variant pack (offline-only).

## 2026-03-26 01:01 KST — Cycle DU microline variant pack follow-up
- Completed: weekly digest now emits PULSE REMAP SCENE MICROLINE VARIANT PACK payload + markdown rows with confidence-aware selected/primary/alternate/fallback lines (offline-only).
- Verification: [PASS] weekly portal prompt readability drift regression checks passed after adding payload contract + markdown assertions.
- Backlog: injected Cycle DU ideas; shipped Systems/QA churn coverage slice, queued UX/World compact alias + AI Content/World diversification policy.
- 2026-03-26 01:37 KST — World readability handoff improved via compact variant-pack selection alias output (`PRSMV`) to reduce scan friction in portal microline digest rows. Follow-up: validate readability with next scene-microline iteration task.

## 2026-03-26 02:02 KST — Cycle DU follow-up (offline microline diversification policy)
- Completed: added offline policy token `PULSE REMAP SCENE MICROLINE STYLE POLICY:ANCHOR|BLEND|DIVERSIFY` derived from cadence-memory volatility (`priorNet/currentNet` delta + trend + lane cadence recency).
- Evidence: `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` + regression lock updates in `scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS).
- Follow-up: if all actionable backlog items remain complete, trigger next Game Director cycle injection with 3 ideas and one selected vertical slice.

## 2026-03-26 02:08 KST — Cycle DV Game Director slice
- Review executed: generated 3 ideas (low/mid/high), selected low-risk compact alias experiment.
- Completed slice: `PRSMP:<A|B|D>` compact alias for `PULSE REMAP SCENE MICROLINE STYLE POLICY`, gated by `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_PULSE_REMAP_SCENE_MICROLINE_STYLE_POLICY_ALIAS`.
- Verification: `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` and `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS).
- Next backlog injection: token-family churn coverage for `PRSMP` and offline cadence-volatility smoothing policy.

## 2026-03-26 02:34 KST
- Cycle DW follow-up logged.
- Systems/QA slice shipped: added PRSMP/style-policy family churn + family trend visibility and smoothing signal coverage in weekly drift digest.
- Verification: [PASS] weekly portal prompt readability drift regression checks PASS.
- Follow-up: monitor whether PRSMP trend stays FLAT after smoothing adoption; escalate only if sustained UP with high churn.

## 2026-03-26 03:01 KST — Cycle DX world/design cadence sync
- Scope remained offline weekly digest analytics; no portal topology/map asset changes.
- Posture token consumes existing lane-cadence + trend signals for route-ops readability.

## [2026-03-26 03:36 KST] Cycle DY - PRSMPP compact style-posture alias
- Task: Add `PRSMPP:<C|W|A>` alias for `PULSE REMAP SCENE MICROLINE STYLE POSTURE` in weekly digest (flag-gated).
- Decision: Keep runtime untouched; scope limited to digest tokening/payload/markdown/regression.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` => PASS.
- Follow-up: Consider churn-family trend row for `PRSMPP` if alias volatility increases.

- 2026-03-26 04:05 KST: Completed Systems/QA slice for prior-window glint drift visibility. Added `PRSFX FAMILY TREND` (UP|FLAT|DOWN) from `pulseRemapSceneFxGlintAlias` prior-net delta, wired payload keys (`pulseRemapSceneFxGlintFamilyTrendDrift` + `pulseRemapSceneFxGlintFamilyTrendSignals`), and locked via regression assertions.

## [2026-03-26 04:31 KST] Cycle DZ - scene-copy palette recommendation prototype
- Synced: Added offline digest signal `PULSE REMAP SCENE COPY PALETTE REC: COOL|ASH|SCAR` derived from scene flavor + FX glint + posture confidence in `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` (PASS).

## 2026-03-26 05:01 KST

- Verification: `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅, `python3 -m py_compile scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py` ✅.
- [2026-03-26 06:23 KST] No world-map topology changes in Cycle EA; held lane while combat/vfx readability slice executed.
- [2026-03-26 06:52 KST] Cycle EB: closed DMG COMBO observability slice (family churn + offline combo-window retune recommendation) and shipped compact alias token `DCR:<T|H|E>` behind `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_DMG_COMBO_RETUNE_ALIAS` with regression lock.
- [2026-03-26 07:01 KST] Cycle EB follow-up: closed Systems/QA backlog item by adding `DMG COMBO WINDOW RETUNE CONF:LOW|MID|HIGH` + compact alias `DCRC:<L|M|H>` token-family churn coverage in weekly digest payload/markdown, wired flag `DOTPIO_EXPERIMENT_DMG_COMBO_RETUNE_CONF_ALIAS`, and locked with regression (`scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`).
- [2026-03-26 07:31 KST] Cycle EB follow-up closeout: shipped offline `DMG COMBO CHAIN COACH:` narrative line tied to combo-window retune recommendation + pressure/drift cadence signals in `scripts/weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`; locked via regression (`python3 scripts/regression_weekly_portal_prompt_readability_drift.py`).
