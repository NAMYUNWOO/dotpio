## 2026-03-19 04:43:40 KST
- Task: M1 validate map_01~04 progression with portal validator + playtest checklist.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Files: `scripts/regression_map_progression.py`, `logs/playtests/map_01_04_progression_checklist.md`, `ACTION_ITEMS.md`, `TASKS.md`
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/regression_map_progression.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/regression_map_progression.py` ✅ (artifact generated)
  - `python3 scripts/validate_portals.py` ✅ (Maps scanned: 4 / Portals scanned: 14)
- Decisions:
  - Added scripted progression regression that captures map_01~04 reachability + return-path checks and embeds validator output into a durable checklist artifact.
  - Kept manual playtest steps in artifact for runtime transition sanity checks (softlock/combat-loop continuity) that static validation cannot prove.
- Follow-up:
  - Next M1 priority item: add one scripted 30-minute loop checklist and pass it.


## 2026-03-19 05:43:40 KST
- Task: M2 design and implement map_05 layout + portal links.
- Commit: `f1b32bf`
- Files: `maps/map_04.lua`, `maps/map_05.lua`, `ACTION_ITEMS.md`, `TASKS.md`, `logs/playtests/map_01_04_progression_checklist.md`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p maps/map_04.lua maps/map_05.lua` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/validate_portals.py` ✅ (Maps scanned: 5 / Portals scanned: 16)
  - `python3 scripts/regression_map_progression.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added `map_05` as a new dungeon-tier map derived from map_04 baseline to keep collision/loot schema stable for M2 kickoff.
  - Added dedicated `map_04` -> `map_05` portal (`name=05`) and reciprocal `map_05` -> `map_04` return portal (`name=04`) to preserve bidirectional routing.
- Follow-up:
  - Next M2 priority item: design and implement map_06 layout + portal links.

## 2026-03-19 06:12:51 KST
- Task: M2 design and implement map_06 layout + portal links.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Files: `maps/map_05.lua`, `maps/map_06.lua`, `ACTION_ITEMS.md`, `TASKS.md`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p maps/map_05.lua maps/map_06.lua` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/validate_portals.py` ✅ (Maps scanned: 6 / Portals scanned: 18)
  - `python3 scripts/regression_map_progression.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added `map_06` as a new dungeon-tier extension using the proven map_05 schema baseline to keep tile/collision compatibility stable.
  - Added forward routing `map_05` portal `06` at (47,24) and reciprocal return `map_06` portal `05` at (1,13), preserving bidirectional progression integrity.
- Follow-up:
  - Next M2 priority item: add at least 3 new enemy behavior variants.

## 2026-03-19 22:58:37 KST
- Task: P1 add map_07 with tactical choke pattern + portal integration.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Files: `maps/map_06.lua`, `maps/map_07.lua`, `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p maps/map_06.lua maps/map_07.lua` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/validate_portals.py` ✅ (Maps scanned: 7 / Portals scanned: 20)
  - `python3 scripts/regression_map_progression.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added new `map_07` based on the stable map_06 schema and introduced added central collision barricades to create tighter tactical choke movement in the mid lane.
  - Extended portal routing with `map_06` portal `07` (47,13) -> `map_07` portal `06`, and reciprocal `map_07` return portal `06` -> `map_06` portal `07`.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P1 priority item: add 2 new enemy archetypes with synergy behavior.

### 2026-03-19 23:59 KST
- Task: Mission momentum bonus payout experiment (objective completion streak SRL micro-reward).
- Decision: Logged lane impact for streak-based reward model (1,1,2 SRL) with reward cap and no duplicate payout on already-complete objectives.
- Evidence: `src/run_missions.lua`, `main.lua`, `scripts/regression_mission_momentum.lua` (+ mission regressions).
- Follow-up: Monitor telemetry for early-run SRL inflation and tune reward curve if low-tier churn increases.
