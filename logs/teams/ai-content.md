## 2026-03-19 06:46:23 KST
- Task: M2 add enemy behavior variants (skirmisher/bruiser/sentinel) with spawn mix + regression coverage.
- Commit: `HEAD (this run)`
- Files changed:
  - `src/enemy_ai.lua`
  - `src/entities.lua`
  - `scripts/regression_enemy_behavior_variants.lua`
  - `ACTION_ITEMS.md`
  - `TASKS.md`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p src/enemy_ai.lua src/entities.lua scripts/regression_enemy_behavior_variants.lua` ✅
  - `lua scripts/regression_enemy_behavior_variants.lua` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added data-driven AI behavior profiles so variants change movement/aggro/flee/attack cadence without branching per-map scripts.
  - Spawn now mixes weighted variants with differentiated HP pools to increase encounter diversity in M2 maps.
- Follow-up:
  - Next M2 priority is AI build output category diversity constraints; keep new enemy pressure in mind when tuning output rewards.

## 2026-03-19 07:13:57 KST
- Task: M2 expand AI build output category diversity constraints.
- Commit: `HEAD (this run)`
- Files changed:
  - `src/ai_describe.lua`
  - `scripts/regression_build_category_diversity.lua`
  - `ACTION_ITEMS.md`
  - `TASKS.md`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p src/ai_describe.lua scripts/regression_build_category_diversity.lua` ✅
  - `lua scripts/regression_build_category_diversity.lua` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added rolling build-category diversity guardrail (window=6, cap=3) so repeated AI target categories are auto-shifted to underused synergy categories when saturated.
  - Added component-category -> build-category mapping to keep diversity shifts thematically consistent instead of random fallback.
  - Added debug/regression hooks to lock constraint behavior and history window bounds.
- Follow-up:
  - Next M2 priority is reward table tuning by map tier; run economy/loot validation together with diversity guardrails.

## 2026-03-19 07:43:35 KST
- Task: M2 reward table pass for lootbox contents by map tier.
- Commit: `HEAD (this run)`
- Files changed:
  - `src/entities.lua`
  - `scripts/regression_lootbox_rewards_by_tier.lua`
  - `ACTION_ITEMS.md`
  - `TASKS.md`
- Verification:
  - `luac -p src/entities.lua scripts/regression_lootbox_rewards_by_tier.lua` ✅
  - `lua scripts/regression_lootbox_rewards_by_tier.lua` ✅
  - `lua scripts/regression_build_category_diversity.lua` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added map-tiered loot reward profiles (tier1=consumable-heavy, tier2=balanced gear ramp, tier3=gear/accessory weighted) for lootbox item generation.
  - Excluded synthetic system items from lootbox drops and added deterministic distribution regression to lock tier envelopes.
- Follow-up:
  - Next M3 priority: run mission prototype (3 objectives).

## 2026-03-19 23:29:10 KST
- Task: P1 add two new enemy archetypes with synergy behavior (`warcaller`, `hunter`).
- Commit: `HEAD (this run)`
- Files changed:
  - `src/enemy_ai.lua`
  - `src/entities.lua`
  - `scripts/regression_enemy_behavior_variants.lua`
  - `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification:
  - `lua scripts/regression_enemy_behavior_variants.lua` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added `warcaller` archetype that alerts nearby allies into chase when it sees the player (group aggression trigger).
  - Added `hunter` archetype that gets synergy buffs (faster move CD + bonus attack) when near a living `warcaller`.
  - Expanded weighted spawn roster to include both synergy archetypes while preserving baseline variant diversity.
- Follow-up:
  - Next highest-priority unchecked item is `Add mission variety pack (at least +5 objectives)`.

### 2026-03-19 23:59 KST
- Task: Mission momentum bonus payout experiment (objective completion streak SRL micro-reward).
- Decision: Logged lane impact for streak-based reward model (1,1,2 SRL) with reward cap and no duplicate payout on already-complete objectives.
- Evidence: `src/run_missions.lua`, `main.lua`, `scripts/regression_mission_momentum.lua` (+ mission regressions).
- Follow-up: Monitor telemetry for early-run SRL inflation and tune reward curve if low-tier churn increases.

## 2026-03-20 00:26 KST — cross-lane sync note
- Context: World/System completed map_03~07 identity metadata + encounter rhythm profile wiring.
- Impact: No content schema break; existing flows remain stable with differentiated pacing.
- Follow-up: Validate player readability and portal landmark cues in upcoming portal reposition task.

## 2026-03-20 00:58 KST
- Cross-lane note: World portal reposition pass completed for map_03~07 with validator/regression green.
- Impact: traversal landmarks and fallback routes are clearer; no economy/combat/UI schema changes required in this patch.
- Follow-up: monitor playtest readability feedback and tune labels/cues if confusion persists.

## 2026-03-20 01:28:00 KST
- Task: P2 backlog item `Add weekly sustain audit JSON pretty mode`.
- Commit: HEAD (pending)
- Files:
  - `scripts/audit_weekly_sustain_cron.sh`
  - `scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py`
  - `POST_RC_BACKLOG.md`
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/regression_weekly_cron_audit.py` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Added `--pretty` flag for `--format json` to emit indented, human-readable audit payload while keeping compact JSON default stable.
  - Added guardrail: `--pretty` rejects non-JSON formats to avoid ambiguous output modes.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P2 priority: `Add sustain health dashboard markdown report`.

## 2026-03-20 01:59:00 KST
- Task: P2 backlog item `Add sustain health dashboard markdown report`.
- Commit: HEAD (pending)
- Files:
  - scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py
  - scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py
  - scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh
  - logs/playtests/rc_checklist.md
  - POST_RC_BACKLOG.md
  - logs/sustain_health_dashboard.md
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/sustain_health_dashboard.py scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py` ✅
  - `python3 scripts/regression_sustain_health_dashboard.py` ✅
  - `bash scripts/run_weekly_sustain.sh` ✅
- Decisions:
  - Weekly sustain runner now emits a single markdown dashboard rollup (economy safety, telemetry freshness, scheduler audit signal).
  - Dashboard consumes cron audit JSON when available and degrades gracefully to warning when managed cron entry is absent.
- Follow-up:
  - Next P2 priority: `Add automatic stale-branch/report drift check`.

## 2026-03-20 02:26 KST — P2 stale-branch/report drift guardrail handoff
- AI-content lane aligned on report freshness guardrail so generated-content safety reports can be monitored via shared sustain workflow.
- Decision: checker reads `generatedAt` when present and falls back to file mtime for markdown-only artifacts.
- Follow-up: if AI-content reports adopt JSON artifacts, include them in checker `--report-path` list.

## 2026-03-20 03:00 KST — P2 sustain dashboard JSON mode handoff
- AI-content lane aligned on machine-readable sustain summary for future content-quality signal aggregation.
- Decision: preserve stable key names (`overall`, `signals`, `weeklySnapshot`) for script consumers.
- Follow-up: include AI-content safety metrics when dedicated JSON artifact is available.

## 2026-03-20 03:29 KST — P2 sustain dashboard trend classification handoff
- AI-content lane aligned on additive `overall.trend` field for downstream automation.
- Decision: preserve stable value set (`improving`, `stable`, `degrading`) for parser simplicity.
- Follow-up: extend with AI-content-specific trend inputs once dedicated weekly metrics land.

## 2026-03-20 03:58 KST — cross-lane handoff
- AI-content lane aligned on exposing mission pack/streak context for better player readability of rotating objective design.
- Decision: keep mission catalog semantics unchanged; this patch is visibility-only.
- Follow-up: consider adding pack-level flavor descriptors in future mission metadata.

## 2026-03-20 04:29 KST
- Task: AI content logic unchanged for this cycle.
- Commit: HEAD (this run)
- Verification: N/A (no ai_describe/ai_worker changes)
- Decisions:
  - Mission reward variety bonus implemented without altering generation constraints.

## 2026-03-20 04:59 KST
- Task: AI-content lane review for mission-pack flavor metadata.
- Verification: Reused mission regressions (`regression_run_summary`, `regression_mission_variety_pack`) ✅
- Decisions:
  - Flavor labels are deterministic metadata (not generated text), preserving current AI safety/output envelope.

## 2026-03-20 05:29 KST
- Cross-lane review: no AI text generation/prompt pipeline changes required.
- Decision: enemy behavior expansion remains data/profile-driven in runtime combat logic; AI content safeguards unchanged.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 06:02 KST
- Cross-lane review: no AI generation or prompt safety pipeline changes.
- Decision: pre-lunge tell is runtime combat/UI signaling only; AI-content safeguards remain unchanged.

## 2026-03-20 06:30 KST — Berserker pattern readability guardrail
- Decision: desperation attack chain now includes deterministic recovery phase to reduce opaque burst chaining.
- Impact: behavior profile remains aggressive but easier to parse in text/HUD feedback channels.
- Follow-up: consider exposing behavior-sequence hints in future enemy glossary/help content.

## 2026-03-20 06:58 KST — HUD berserker recovery counter readability slice
- No AI generation prompt/schema changes; content lane unchanged.
- Follow-up: none.

## 2026-03-20 07:26 KST — No AI generation rule changes
- Scope check: preview hint uses existing mission lane metadata; no AI prompt/category constraint updates required.
- Follow-up: if AI-authored mission packs land, ensure lane tags are always present for preview rendering.
